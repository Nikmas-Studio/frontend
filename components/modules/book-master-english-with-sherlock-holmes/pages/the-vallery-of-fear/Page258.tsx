              “I'll get even with you without needing to dirty my hands,” said
              his enemy. “You'll wish you had never set foot in this house
              before I am through with you!”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“No time like the present,” cried McMurdo.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I'll choose my own time, mister. You can leave the time to me.
              See here!” He suddenly rolled up his sleeve and showed upon his
              forearm a peculiar sign which appeared to have been branded there.
              It was a circle with a triangle within it. “D'you know what that
              means?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“I neither know nor care!”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, you will know, I'll promise you that. You won't be much
              older, either. Perhaps Miss Ettie can tell you something about it.
              As to you, Ettie, you'll come back to me on your knees—d'ye hear,
              girl?—on your knees—and then I'll tell you what your punishment
              may be. You've sowed—and by the Lord, I'll see that you reap!” He
              glanced at them both in fury. Then he turned upon his heel, and an
              instant later the outer door had banged behind him.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              For a few moments McMurdo and the girl stood in silence. Then she
              threw her arms around him.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Oh, Jack, how brave you were! But it is no use, you must fly!
              To-night—Jack—to-night! It's your only hope. He will have your
              life. I read it in his horrible eyes. What chance have you against
              a dozen of them, with Boss McGinty and all the power of the lodge
              behind them?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              McMurdo disengaged her hands, kissed her, and gently pushed her
              back into a chair. “There, acushla, there! Don't be disturbed or
              fear for me. I'm a Freeman myself. I'm after telling your father
              about it. Maybe I am no better than the others; so don't make a
              saint of me. Perhaps you hate me too, now that I've told you as
              much?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Hate you, Jack? While life lasts I could never do that! I've
              heard that there is no harm in being a Freeman anywhere but here;
              so why should I think the worse of you for that? But if you are a
              Freeman, Jack, why should you not go down and make a friend of
              Boss McGinty? Oh, hurry, Jack, hurry! Get your word in first, or
              the hounds will be on your trail.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I was thinking the same thing,” said McMurdo. “I'll go right now
              and fix it. You can tell your father that I'll sleep here to-night
              and find some other quarters in the morning.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              The bar of McGinty's saloon was crowded as usual, for it was the
              favourite loafing place of all the rougher elements of the town.
              The man was popular; for he had a rough, jovial disposition which
              formed a mask, covering a great deal which lay behind it. But
              apart from this popularity, the fear in which he was held
              throughout the township, and indeed down the whole thirty miles of
              the valley and past the mountains on each side of it, was enough
              in itself to fill his bar; for none could afford to neglect his
              good will.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              Besides those secret powers which it was universally believed that
              he exercised in so pitiless a fashion, he was a high public
              official, a municipal councillor, and a commissioner of roads,
              elected to the office through the votes of the ruffians who in
              turn expected to receive favours at his hands. Assessments and
              taxes were enormous; the public works were notoriously neglected,
              the accounts were slurred over by bribed auditors, and the decent
              citizen was terrorized into paying public blackmail, and holding
              his tongue lest some worse thing befall him.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              Thus it was that, year by year, Boss McGinty's diamond pins became
              more obtrusive, his gold chains more weighty across a more
              gorgeous vest, and his saloon stretched farther and farther, until
              it threatened to absorb one whole side of the Market Square.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              McMurdo pushed open the swinging door of the saloon and made his
              way amid the crowd of men within, through an atmosphere blurred
              with tobacco smoke and heavy with the smell of spirits. The place
              was brilliantly lighted, and the huge, heavily gilt mirrors upon
              every wall reflected and multiplied the garish illumination. There
              were several bartenders in their shirt sleeves, hard at work
              mixing drinks for the loungers who fringed the broad,
              brass-trimmed counter.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              At the far end, with his body resting upon the bar and a cigar
              stuck at an acute angle from the corner of his mouth, stood a
              tall, strong, heavily built man who could be none other than the
              famous McGinty himself. He was a black-maned giant, bearded to the
              cheek-bones, and with a shock of raven hair which fell to his
              collar. His complexion was as swarthy as that of an Italian, and
              his eyes were of a strange dead black, which, combined with a
              slight squint, gave them a particularly sinister appearance.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              All else in the man—his noble proportions, his fine features, and
              his frank bearing—fitted in with that jovial, man-to-man manner
              which he affected. Here, one would say, is a bluff, honest fellow,
              whose heart would be sound however rude his outspoken words might
              seem. It was only when those dead, dark eyes, deep and
              remorseless, were turned upon a man that he shrank within himself,
              feeling that he was face to face with an infinite possibility of
              latent evil, with a strength and courage and cunning behind it
              which made it a thousand times more deadly.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              Having had a good look at his man, McMurdo elbowed his way forward
              with his usual careless audacity, and pushed himself through the
              little group of courtiers who were fawning upon the powerful boss,
              laughing uproariously at the smallest of his jokes. The young
              stranger's bold gray eyes looked back fearlessly through their
              glasses at the deadly black ones which turned sharply upon him.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, young man, I can't call your face to mind.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“I'm new here, Mr. McGinty.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “You are not so new that you can't give a gentleman his proper
              title.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “He's Councillor McGinty, young man,” said a voice from the group.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I'm sorry, Councillor. I'm strange to the ways of the place. But
              I was advised to see you.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, you see me. This is all there is. What d'you think of me?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, it's early days. If your heart is as big as your body, and
              your soul as fine as your face, then I'd ask for nothing better,”
              said McMurdo.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “By Gar! you've got an Irish tongue in your head anyhow,” cried
              the saloon-keeper, not quite certain whether to humour this
              audacious visitor or to stand upon his dignity.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“So you are good enough to pass my appearance?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Sure,” said McMurdo.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“And you were told to see me?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“I was.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“And who told you?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Brother Scanlan of Lodge 341, Vermissa. I drink your health
              Councillor, and to our better acquaintance.” He raised a glass
              with which he had been served to his lips and elevated his little
              finger as he drank it.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              McGinty, who had been watching him narrowly, raised his thick
              black eyebrows. “Oh, it's like that, is it?” said he. “I'll have
              to look a bit closer into this, Mister—”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“McMurdo.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “A bit closer, Mr. McMurdo; for we don't take folk on trust in
              these parts, nor believe all we're told neither. Come in here for
              a moment, behind the bar.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              There was a small room there, lined with barrels. McGinty
              carefully closed the door, and then seated himself on one of them,
              biting thoughtfully on his cigar and surveying his companion with
              those disquieting eyes. For a couple of minutes he sat in complete
              silence. McMurdo bore the inspection cheerfully, one hand in his
              coat pocket, the other twisting his brown moustache. Suddenly
              McGinty stooped and produced a wicked-looking revolver.

            <TextNode>
              “See here, my joker,” said he, “if I thought you were playing any
              game on us, it would be short work for you.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “This is a strange welcome,” McMurdo answered with some dignity,
              “for the Bodymaster of a lodge of Freemen to give to a stranger
              brother.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Ay, but it's just that same that you have to prove,” said
              McGinty, “and God help you if you fail! Where were you made?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Lodge 29, Chicago.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“When?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“June 24, 1872.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“What Bodymaster?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“James H. Scott.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Who is your district ruler?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Bartholomew Wilson.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Hum! You seem glib enough in your tests. What are you doing
              here?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Working, the same as you—but a poorer job.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“You have your back answer quick enough.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Yes, I was always quick of speech.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Are you quick of action?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I have had that name among those that knew me best.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, we may try you sooner than you think. Have you heard
              anything of the lodge in these parts?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I've heard that it takes a man to be a brother.”

              “True for you, Mr. McMurdo. Why did you leave Chicago?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“I'm damned if I tell you that!”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              McGinty opened his eyes. He was not used to being answered in such
              fashion, and it amused him. “Why won't you tell me?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Because no brother may tell another a lie.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Then the truth is too bad to tell?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“You can put it that way if you like.”</TextNode>
            <TextNode>
              “See here, mister, you can't expect me, as Bodymaster, to pass
              into the lodge a man for whose past he can't answer.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              McMurdo looked puzzled. Then he took a worn newspaper cutting from
              an inner pocket.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“You wouldn't squeal on a fellow?” said he.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I'll wipe my hand across your face if you say such words to me!”
              cried McGinty hotly.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “You are right, Councillor,” said McMurdo meekly. “I should
              apologize. I spoke without thought. Well, I know that I am safe in
              your hands. Look at that clipping.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              McGinty glanced his eyes over the account of the shooting of one
              Jonas Pinto, in the Lake Saloon, Market Street, Chicago, in the
              New Year week of 1874.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Your work?” he asked, as he handed back the paper.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>McMurdo nodded.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Why did you shoot him?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I was helping Uncle Sam to make dollars. Maybe mine were not as
              good gold as his, but they looked as well and were cheaper to
              make. This man Pinto helped me to shove the queer—”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“To do what?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, it means to pass the dollars out into circulation. Then he
              said he would split. Maybe he did split. I didn't wait to see. I
              just killed him and lighted out for the coal country.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Why the coal country?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “'Cause I'd read in the papers that they weren't too particular in
              those parts.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              McGinty laughed. “You were first a coiner and then a murderer, and
              you came to these parts because you thought you'd be welcome.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “That's about the size of it,” McMurdo answered.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, I guess you'll go far. Say, can you make those dollars
              yet?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              McMurdo took half a dozen from his pocket. “Those never passed the
              Philadelphia mint,” said he.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “You don't say!” McGinty held them to the light in his enormous
              hand, which was hairy as a gorilla's. “I can see no difference.
              Gar! you'll be a mighty useful brother, I'm thinking! We can do
              with a bad man or two among us, Friend McMurdo: for there are
              times when we have to take our own part. We'd soon be against the
              wall if we didn't shove back at those that were pushing us.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, I guess I'll do my share of shoving with the rest of the

            <TextNode>
              “You seem to have a good nerve. You didn't squirm when I shoved

            <TextNode>“It was not me that was in danger.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Who then?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “It was you, Councillor.” McMurdo drew a cocked pistol from the
              side pocket of his peajacket. “I was covering you all the time. I
              guess my shot would have been as quick as yours.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “By Gar!” McGinty flushed an angry red and then burst into a roar
              of laughter. “Say, we've had no such holy terror come to hand this
              many a year. I reckon the lodge will learn to be proud of you …
              Well, what the hell do you want? And can't I speak alone with a

              The bartender stood abashed. “I'm sorry, Councillor, but it's Ted
              Baldwin. He says he must see you this very minute.”

              The message was unnecessary; for the set, cruel face of the man
              himself was looking over the servant's shoulder. He pushed the
              bartender out and closed the door on him.

              “So,” said he with a furious glance at McMurdo, “you got here
              first, did you? I've a word to say to you, Councillor, about this
              man.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Then say it here and now before my face,” cried McMurdo.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“I'll say it at my own time, in my own way.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Tut! Tut!” said McGinty, getting off his barrel. “This will never
              do. We have a new brother here, Baldwin, and it's not for us to
              greet him in such fashion. Hold out your hand, man, and make it
              up!”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Never!” cried Baldwin in a fury.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I've offered to fight him if he thinks I have wronged him,” said
              McMurdo. “I'll fight him with fists, or, if that won't satisfy
              him, I'll fight him any other way he chooses. Now, I'll leave it
              to you, Councillor, to judge between us as a Bodymaster should.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“What is it, then?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “A young lady. She's free to choose for herself.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Is she?” cried Baldwin.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “As between two brothers of the lodge I should say that she was,”
              said the Boss.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Oh, that's your ruling, is it?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Yes, it is, Ted Baldwin,” said McGinty, with a wicked stare. “Is
              it you that would dispute it?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “You would throw over one that has stood by you this five years in
              favour of a man that you never saw before in your life? You're not
              Bodymaster for life, Jack McGinty, and by God! when next it comes
              to a vote—”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              The Councillor sprang at him like a tiger. His hand closed round
              the other's neck, and he hurled him back across one of the
              barrels. In his mad fury he would have squeezed the life out of
              him if McMurdo had not interfered.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Easy, Councillor! For heaven's sake, go easy!” he cried, as he
              dragged him back.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              McGinty released his hold, and Baldwin, cowed and shaken gasping
              for breath, and shivering in every limb, as one who has looked
              over the very edge of death, sat up on the barrel over which he
              had been hurled.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “You've been asking for it this many a day, Ted Baldwin—now you've
              got it!” cried McGinty, his huge chest rising and falling. “Maybe
              you think if I was voted down from Bodymaster you would find
              yourself in my shoes. It's for the lodge to say that. But so long
              as I am the chief I'll have no man lift his voice against me or my
              rulings.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I have nothing against you,” mumbled Baldwin, feeling his throat.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, then,” cried the other, relapsing in a moment into a bluff
              joviality, “we are all good friends again and there's an end of
              the matter.”

              He took a bottle of champagne down from the shelf and twisted out
              the cork.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “See now,” he continued, as he filled three high glasses. “Let us
              drink the quarrelling toast of the lodge. After that, as you know,
              there can be no bad blood between us. Now, then the left hand on
              the apple of my throat. I say to you, Ted Baldwin, what is the
              offense, sir?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“The clouds are heavy,” answered Baldwin.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“But they will forever brighten.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“And this I swear!”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              The men drank their glasses, and the same ceremony was performed
              between Baldwin and McMurdo
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “There!” cried McGinty, rubbing his hands. “That's the end of the
              black blood. You come under lodge discipline if it goes further,
              and that's a heavy hand in these parts, as Brother Baldwin
              knows—and as you will damn soon find out, Brother McMurdo, if you
              ask for trouble!”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Faith, I'd be slow to do that,” said McMurdo. He held out his
              hand to Baldwin. “I'm quick to quarrel and quick to forgive. It's
              my hot Irish blood, they tell me. But it's over for me, and I bear
              no grudge.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              Baldwin had to take the proffered hand, for the baleful eye of the
              terrible Boss was upon him. But his sullen face showed how little
              the words of the other had moved him.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              McGinty clapped them both on the shoulders. “Tut! These girls!
              These girls!” he cried. “To think that the same petticoats should
              come between two of my boys! It's the devil's own luck! Well, it's
              the colleen inside of them that must settle the question for it's
              outside the jurisdiction of a Bodymaster—and the Lord be praised
              for that! We have enough on us, without the women as well. You'll
              have to be affiliated to Lodge 341, Brother McMurdo. We have our
              own ways and methods, different from Chicago. Saturday night is
              our meeting, and if you come then, we'll make you free forever of
              the Vermissa Valley.”
