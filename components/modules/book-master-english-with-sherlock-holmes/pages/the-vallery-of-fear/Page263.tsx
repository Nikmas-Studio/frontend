              If anything had been needed to give an impetus to Jack McMurdo's
              popularity among his fellows it would have been his arrest and
              acquittal. That a man on the very night of joining the lodge
              should have done something which brought him before the magistrate
              was a new record in the annals of the society. Already he had
              earned the reputation of a good boon companion, a cheery reveller,
              and withal a man of high temper, who would not take an insult even
              from the all-powerful Boss himself. But in addition to this he
              impressed his comrades with the idea that among them all there was
              not one whose brain was so ready to devise a bloodthirsty scheme,
              or whose hand would be more capable of carrying it out. “He'll be
              the boy for the clean job,” said the oldsters to one another, and
              waited their time until they could set him to his work.

              McGinty had instruments enough already; but he recognized that
              this was a supremely able one. He felt like a man holding a fierce
              bloodhound in leash. There were curs to do the smaller work; but
              some day he would slip this creature upon its prey. A few members
              of the lodge, Ted Baldwin among them, resented the rapid rise of
              the stranger and hated him for it; but they kept clear of him, for
              he was as ready to fight as to laugh.

            <TextNode>
              But if he gained favour with his fellows, there was another
              quarter, one which had become even more vital to him, in which he
              lost it. Ettie Shafter's father would have nothing more to do with
              him, nor would he allow him to enter the house. Ettie herself was
              too deeply in love to give him up altogether, and yet her own good
              sense warned her of what would come from a marriage with a man who
              was regarded as a criminal.

              One morning after a sleepless night she determined to see him,
              possibly for the last time, and make one strong endeavour to draw
              him from those evil influences which were sucking him down. She
              went to his house, as he had often begged her to do, and made her
              way into the room which he used as his sitting-room. He was seated
              at a table, with his back turned and a letter in front of him. A
              sudden spirit of girlish mischief came over her—she was still only
              nineteen. He had not heard her when she pushed open the door. Now
              she tiptoed forward and laid her hand lightly upon his bended
              shoulders.

            <TextNode>
              If she had expected to startle him, she certainly succeeded; but
              only in turn to be startled herself. With a tiger spring he turned
              on her, and his right hand was feeling for her throat. At the same
              instant with the other hand he crumpled up the paper that lay
              before him. For an instant he stood glaring. Then astonishment and
              joy took the place of the ferocity which had convulsed his
              features—a ferocity which had sent her shrinking back in horror as
              from something which had never before intruded into her gentle
              life.

              “It's you!” said he, mopping his brow. “And to think that you
              should come to me, heart of my heart, and I should find nothing
              better to do than to want to strangle you! Come then, darling,”
              and he held out his arms, “let me make it up to you.”

            <TextNode>
              But she had not recovered from that sudden glimpse of guilty fear
              which she had read in the man's face. All her woman's instinct
              told her that it was not the mere fright of a man who is startled.

              have looked at me like that!”

            <TextNode>“Ah, Ettie, I couldn't do that.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              Her suspicions became certainties. “It's to another woman,” she
              cried. “I know it! Why else should you hold it from me? Was it to
              your wife that you were writing? How am I to know that you are not
              a married man—you, a stranger, that nobody knows?”

              those who hold my promise. It's the business of the lodge, and
              even to you it's secret. And if I was scared when a hand fell on

              came here to-day. Oh, Jack, see—I beg it of you on my bended

              my comrades? If you could see how things stand with me you could
              never ask it of me. Besides, if I wanted to, how could I do it?

              people darkens our lives. He is ready to go. We would fly together

              It was the most that Ettie could obtain, and yet it was something.
              There was this distant light to illuminate the gloom of the
              immediate future. She returned to her father's house more
              light-hearted than she had ever been since Jack McMurdo had come
              into her life.

              It might be thought that as a member, all the doings of the
              society would be told to him; but he was soon to discover that the
              organization was wider and more complex than the simple lodge.
              Even Boss McGinty was ignorant as to many things; for there was an
              official named the County Delegate, living at Hobson's Patch
              farther down the line, who had power over several different lodges
              which he wielded in a sudden and arbitrary way. Only once did
              McMurdo see him, a sly, little gray-haired rat of a man, with a
              slinking gait and a sidelong glance which was charged with malice.
              Evans Pott was his name, and even the great Boss of Vermissa felt
              towards him something of the repulsion and fear which the huge
              Danton may have felt for the puny but dangerous Robespierre.

              One day Scanlan, who was McMurdo's fellow boarder, received a note
              from McGinty inclosing one from Evans Pott, which informed him
              that he was sending over two good men, Lawler and Andrews, who had
              instructions to act in the neighbourhood; though it was best for
              the cause that no particulars as to their objects should be given.
              Would the Bodymaster see to it that suitable arrangements be made
              for their lodgings and comfort until the time for action should
              arrive? McGinty added that it was impossible for anyone to remain
              secret at the Union House, and that, therefore, he would be
              obliged if McMurdo and Scanlan would put the strangers up for a
              few days in their boarding house.

              The same evening the two men arrived, each carrying his gripsack.
              Lawler was an elderly man, shrewd, silent, and self-contained,
              clad in an old black frock coat, which with his soft felt hat and
              ragged, grizzled beard gave him a general resemblance to an
              itinerant preacher. His companion Andrews was little more than a
              boy, frank-faced and cheerful, with the breezy manner of one who
              is out for a holiday and means to enjoy every minute of it. Both
              men were total abstainers, and behaved in all ways as exemplary
              members of the society, with the one simple exception that they
              were assassins who had often proved themselves to be most capable
              instruments for this association of murder. Lawler had already
              carried out fourteen commissions of the kind, and Andrews three.

            <TextNode>
              They were, as McMurdo found, quite ready to converse about their
              deeds in the past, which they recounted with the half-bashful
              pride of men who had done good and unselfish service for the
              community. They were reticent, however, as to the immediate job in
              hand.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “They chose us because neither I nor the boy here drink,” Lawler
              explained. “They can count on us saying no more than we should.
              You must not take it amiss, but it is the orders of the County
              Delegate that we obey.”

            <TextNode>
              “Sure, we are all in it together,” said Scanlan, McMurdo's mate,
              as the four sat together at supper.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “That's true enough, and we'll talk till the cows come home of the
              killing of Charlie Williams or of Simon Bird, or any other job in
              the past. But till the work is done we say nothing.”

            <TextNode>
              “There are half a dozen about here that I have a word to say to,”
              said McMurdo, with an oath. “I suppose it isn't Jack Knox of
              Ironhill that you are after. I'd go some way to see him get his
              deserts.”

            <TextNode>
              Lawler smiled and shook his head. He was not to be drawn.

            <TextNode>
              In spite of the reticence of their guests, Scanlan and McMurdo
              were quite determined to be present at what they called “the fun.”
              When, therefore, at an early hour one morning McMurdo heard them
              creeping down the stairs he awakened Scanlan, and the two hurried
              on their clothes. When they were dressed they found that the
              others had stolen out, leaving the door open behind them. It was
              not yet dawn, and by the light of the lamps they could see the two
              men some distance down the street. They followed them warily,
              treading noiselessly in the deep snow.

              The boarding house was near the edge of the town, and soon they
              were at the crossroads which is beyond its boundary. Here three
              men were waiting, with whom Lawler and Andrews held a short, eager
              conversation. Then they all moved on together. It was clearly some
              notable job which needed numbers. At this point there are several
              trails which lead to various mines. The strangers took that which
              led to the Crow Hill, a huge business which was in strong hands
              which had been able, thanks to their energetic and fearless New
              England manager, Josiah H. Dunn, to keep some order and discipline
              during the long reign of terror.

              McMurdo and Scanlan strolled on with the others, keeping in sight
              of the men whom they followed. A thick mist lay over them, and
              from the heart of it there came the sudden scream of a steam
              whistle. It was the ten-minute signal before the cages descended
              and the day's labour began.

              When they reached the open space round the mine shaft there were a
              hundred miners waiting, stamping their feet and blowing on their
              fingers; for it was bitterly cold. The strangers stood in a little
              group under the shadow of the engine house. Scanlan and McMurdo
              climbed a heap of slag from which the whole scene lay before them.
              They saw the mine engineer, a great bearded Scotchman named
              Menzies, come out of the engine house and blow his whistle for the
              cages to be lowered.

              At the same instant a tall, loose-framed young man with a
              clean-shaved, earnest face advanced eagerly towards the pit head.
              As he came forward his eyes fell upon the group, silent and
              motionless, under the engine house. The men had drawn down their
              hats and turned up their collars to screen their faces. For a
              moment the presentiment of Death laid its cold hand upon the
              manager's heart. At the next he had shaken it off and saw only his
              duty towards intrusive strangers.

              “Who are you?” he asked as he advanced. “What are you loitering
              there for?”

              There was no answer; but the lad Andrews stepped forward and shot
              him in the stomach. The hundred waiting miners stood as motionless
              and helpless as if they were paralyzed. The manager clapped his
              two hands to the wound and doubled himself up. Then he staggered
              away; but another of the assassins fired, and he went down
              sidewise, kicking and clawing among a heap of clinkers. Menzies,
              the Scotchman, gave a roar of rage at the sight and rushed with an
              iron spanner at the murderers; but was met by two balls in the
              face which dropped him dead at their very feet.

              There was a surge forward of some of the miners, and an
              inarticulate cry of pity and of anger; but a couple of the
              strangers emptied their six-shooters over the heads of the crowd,
              and they broke and scattered, some of them rushing wildly back to
              their homes in Vermissa.

              When a few of the bravest had rallied, and there was a return to
              the mine, the murderous gang had vanished in the mists of morning,
              without a single witness being able to swear to the identity of
              these men who in front of a hundred spectators had wrought this
              double crime.

              Scanlan and McMurdo made their way back; Scanlan somewhat subdued,
              for it was the first murder job that he had seen with his own
              eyes, and it appeared less funny than he had been led to believe.
              The horrible screams of the dead manager's wife pursued them as
              they hurried to the town. McMurdo was absorbed and silent; but he
              showed no sympathy for the weakening of his companion.

              There was high revel in the lodge room at the Union House that
              night, not only over the killing of the manager and engineer of
              the Crow Hill mine, which would bring this organization into line
              with the other blackmailed and terror-stricken companies of the
              district, but also over a distant triumph which had been wrought
              by the hands of the lodge itself.

              It would appear that when the County Delegate had sent over five
              good men to strike a blow in Vermissa, he had demanded that in
              return three Vermissa men should be secretly selected and sent
              across to kill William Hales of Stake Royal, one of the best known
              and most popular mine owners in the Gilmerton district, a man who
              was believed not to have an enemy in the world; for he was in all
              ways a model employer. He had insisted, however, upon efficiency
              in the work, and had, therefore, paid off certain drunken and idle
              employees who were members of the all-powerful society. Coffin
              notices hung outside his door had not weakened his resolution, and
              so in a free, civilized country he found himself condemned to
              death.

              The execution had now been duly carried out. Ted Baldwin, who
              sprawled now in the seat of honour beside the Bodymaster, had been
              chief of the party. His flushed face and glazed, blood-shot eyes
              told of sleeplessness and drink. He and his two comrades had spent
              the night before among the mountains. They were unkempt and
              weather-stained. But no heroes, returning from a forlorn hope,
              could have had a warmer welcome from their comrades.

              The story was told and retold amid cries of delight and shouts of
              laughter. They had waited for their man as he drove home at
              nightfall, taking their station at the top of a steep hill, where
              his horse must be at a walk. He was so furred to keep out the cold
              that he could not lay his hand on his pistol. They had pulled him
              out and shot him again and again. He had screamed for mercy. The
              screams were repeated for the amusement of the lodge.
