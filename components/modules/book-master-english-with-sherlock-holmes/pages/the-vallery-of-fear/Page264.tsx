              None of them knew the man; but there is eternal drama in a
              killing, and they had shown the Scowrers of Gilmerton that the
              Vermissa men were to be relied upon.

              There had been one contretemps; for a man and his wife had driven
              up while they were still emptying their revolvers into the silent
              body. It had been suggested that they should shoot them both; but
              they were harmless folk who were not connected with the mines, so
              they were sternly bidden to drive on and keep silent, lest a worse
              thing befall them. And so the blood-mottled figure had been left
              as a warning to all such hard-hearted employers, and the three
              noble avengers had hurried off into the mountains where unbroken
              nature comes down to the very edge of the furnaces and the slag
              heaps. Here they were, safe and sound, their work well done, and
              the plaudits of their companions in their ears.

              It had been a great day for the Scowrers. The shadow had fallen
              even darker over the valley. But as the wise general chooses the
              moment of victory in which to redouble his efforts, so that his
              foes may have no time to steady themselves after disaster, so Boss
              McGinty, looking out upon the scene of his operations with his
              brooding and malicious eyes, had devised a new attack upon those
              who opposed him. That very night, as the half-drunken company
              broke up, he touched McMurdo on the arm and led him aside into
              that inner room where they had their first interview.

              “See here, my lad,” said he, “I've got a job that's worthy of you

              Chester Wilcox has been settled, and you'll have the thanks of

              McGinty took his eternal half-chewed, half-smoked cigar from the
              corner of his mouth, and proceeded to draw a rough diagram on a
              page torn from his notebook.

              “He's the chief foreman of the Iron Dike Company. He's a hard
              citizen, an old colour sergeant of the war, all scars and grizzle.
              We've had two tries at him; but had no luck, and Jim Carnaway lost
              his life over it. Now it's for you to take it over. That's the
              house—all alone at the Iron Dike crossroad, same as you see here
              on the map—without another within earshot. It's no good by day.
              He's armed and shoots quick and straight, with no questions asked.
              But at night—well, there he is with his wife, three children, and
              a hired help. You can't pick or choose. It's all or none. If you

              “Very good,” said McGinty, shaking him by the hand. “I leave it

              McMurdo thought long and deeply over the commission which had been
              so suddenly placed in his hands. The isolated house in which
              Chester Wilcox lived was about five miles off in an adjacent
              valley. That very night he started off all alone to prepare for
              the attempt. It was daylight before he returned from his
              reconnaissance. Next day he interviewed his two subordinates,
              Manders and Reilly, reckless youngsters who were as elated as if
              it were a deer-hunt.

              Two nights later they met outside the town, all three armed, and
              one of them carrying a sack stuffed with the powder which was used
              in the quarries. It was two in the morning before they came to the
              lonely house. The night was a windy one, with broken clouds
              drifting swiftly across the face of a three-quarter moon. They had
              been warned to be on their guard against bloodhounds; so they
              moved forward cautiously, with their pistols cocked in their
              hands. But there was no sound save the howling of the wind, and no
              movement but the swaying branches above them.

            <TextNode>
              McMurdo listened at the door of the lonely house; but all was
              still within. Then he leaned the powder bag against it, ripped a
              hole in it with his knife, and attached the fuse. When it was well
              alight he and his two companions took to their heels, and were
              some distance off, safe and snug in a sheltering ditch, before the
              shattering roar of the explosion, with the low, deep rumble of the
              collapsing building, told them that their work was done. No
              cleaner job had ever been carried out in the bloodstained annals
              of the society.

              But alas that work so well organized and boldly carried out should
              all have gone for nothing! Warned by the fate of the various
              victims, and knowing that he was marked down for destruction,
              Chester Wilcox had moved himself and his family only the day
              before to some safer and less known quarters, where a guard of
              police should watch over them. It was an empty house which had
              been torn down by the gunpowder, and the grim old colour sergeant
              of the war was still teaching discipline to the miners of Iron
              Dike.

              “Leave him to me,” said McMurdo. “He's my man, and I'll get him
              sure if I have to wait a year for him.”

            <TextNode>
              A vote of thanks and confidence was passed in full lodge, and so
              for the time the matter ended. When a few weeks later it was
              reported in the papers that Wilcox had been shot at from an
              ambuscade, it was an open secret that McMurdo was still at work
              upon his unfinished job.

              Such were the methods of the Society of Freemen, and such were the
              deeds of the Scowrers by which they spread their rule of fear over
              the great and rich district which was for so long a period haunted
              by their terrible presence. Why should these pages be stained by
              further crimes? Have I not said enough to show the men and their
              methods?

              These deeds are written in history, and there are records wherein
              one may read the details of them. There one may learn of the
              shooting of Policemen Hunt and Evans because they had ventured to
              arrest two members of the society—a double outrage planned at the
              Vermissa lodge and carried out in cold blood upon two helpless and
              disarmed men. There also one may read of the shooting of Mrs.
              Larbey when she was nursing her husband, who had been beaten
              almost to death by orders of Boss McGinty. The killing of the
              elder Jenkins, shortly followed by that of his brother, the
              mutilation of James Murdoch, the blowing up of the Staphouse
              family, and the murder of the Stendals all followed hard upon one
              another in the same terrible winter.

              Darkly the shadow lay upon the Valley of Fear. The spring had come
              with running brooks and blossoming trees. There was hope for all
              Nature bound so long in an iron grip; but nowhere was there any
              hope for the men and women who lived under the yoke of the terror.
              Never had the cloud above them been so dark and hopeless as in the
              early summer of the year 1875.
