              Somewhat eased in mind, now that his own preparations for escape
              had been begun, McMurdo went on to the lodge. It had already
              assembled, and only by complicated signs and counter-signs could
              he pass through the outer guard and inner guard who close-tiled
              it. A buzz of pleasure and welcome greeted him as he entered. The
              long room was crowded, and through the haze of tobacco smoke he
              saw the tangled black mane of the Bodymaster, the cruel,
              unfriendly features of Baldwin, the vulture face of Harraway, the
              secretary, and a dozen more who were among the leaders of the
              lodge. He rejoiced that they should all be there to take counsel
              over his news.

              “Indeed, it's glad we are to see you, Brother!” cried the
              chairman. “There's business here that wants a Solomon in judgment
              to set it right.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “It's Lander and Egan,” explained his neighbour as he took his
              seat. “They both claim the head money given by the lodge for the
              shooting of old man Crabbe over at Stylestown, and who's to say
              which fired the bullet?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              McMurdo rose in his place and raised his hand. The expression of
              his face froze the attention of the audience. There was a dead
              hush of expectation.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Eminent Bodymaster,” he said, in a solemn voice, “I claim
              urgency!”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Brother McMurdo claims urgency,” said McGinty. “It's a claim that
              by the rules of this lodge takes precedence. Now Brother, we
              attend you.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>McMurdo took the letter from his pocket.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Eminent Bodymaster and Brethren,” he said, “I am the bearer of
              ill news this day; but it is better that it should be known and
              discussed, than that a blow should fall upon us without warning
              which would destroy us all. I have information that the most
              powerful and richest organizations in this state have bound
              themselves together for our destruction, and that at this very
              moment there is a Pinkerton detective, one Birdy Edwards, at work
              in the valley collecting the evidence which may put a rope round
              the necks of many of us, and send every man in this room into a
              felon's cell. That is the situation for the discussion of which I
              have made a claim of urgency.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              There was a dead silence in the room. It was broken by the
              chairman.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “What is your evidence for this, Brother McMurdo?” he asked.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “It is in this letter which has come into my hands,” said McMurdo.
              He read the passage aloud. “It is a matter of honour with me that
              I can give no further particulars about the letter, nor put it
              into your hands; but I assure you that there is nothing else in it
              which can affect the interests of the lodge. I put the case before
              you as it has reached me.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Let me say, Mr. Chairman,” said one of the older brethren, “that
              I have heard of Birdy Edwards, and that he has the name of being
              the best man in the Pinkerton service.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Does anyone know him by sight?” asked McGinty.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Yes,” said McMurdo, “I do.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              There was a murmur of astonishment through the hall.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I believe we hold him in the hollow of our hands,” he continued
              with an exulting smile upon his face. “If we act quickly and
              wisely, we can cut this thing short. If I have your confidence and
              your help, it is little that we have to fear.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “What have we to fear, anyhow? What can he know of our affairs?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “You might say so if all were as stanch as you, Councillor. But
              this man has all the millions of the capitalists at his back. Do
              you think there is no weaker brother among all our lodges that
              could not be bought? He will get at our secrets—maybe has got them
              already. There's only one sure cure.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “That he never leaves the valley,” said Baldwin.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              McMurdo nodded. “Good for you, Brother Baldwin,” he said. “You and
              I have had our differences, but you have said the true word
              to-night.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Where is he, then? Where shall we know him?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Eminent Bodymaster,” said McMurdo, earnestly, “I would put it to
              you that this is too vital a thing for us to discuss in open
              lodge. God forbid that I should throw a doubt on anyone here; but
              if so much as a word of gossip got to the ears of this man, there
              would be an end of any chance of our getting him. I would ask the
              lodge to choose a trusty committee, Mr. Chairman—yourself, if I
              might suggest it, and Brother Baldwin here, and five more. Then I
              can talk freely of what I know and of what I advise should be
              done.”

          <BookRightPartContainer>
            <TextNode noIndent>
              The proposition was at once adopted, and the committee chosen.
              Besides the chairman and Baldwin there were the vulture-faced
              secretary, Harraway, Tiger Cormac, the brutal young assassin,
              Carter, the treasurer, and the brothers Willaby, fearless and
              desperate men who would stick at nothing.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              The usual revelry of the lodge was short and subdued: for there
              was a cloud upon the men's spirits, and many there for the first
              time began to see the cloud of avenging Law drifting up in that
              serene sky under which they had dwelt so long. The horrors they
              had dealt out to others had been so much a part of their settled
              lives that the thought of retribution had become a remote one, and
              so seemed the more startling now that it came so closely upon
              them. They broke up early and left their leaders to their council.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Now, McMurdo!” said McGinty when they were alone. The seven men
              sat frozen in their seats.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I said just now that I knew Birdy Edwards,” McMurdo explained. “I
              need not tell you that he is not here under that name. He's a
              brave man, but not a crazy one. He passes under the name of Steve
              Wilson, and he is lodging at Hobson's Patch.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“How do you know this?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Because I fell into talk with him. I thought little of it at the
              time, nor would have given it a second thought but for this
              letter; but now I'm sure it's the man. I met him on the cars when
              I went down the line on Wednesday—a hard case if ever there was
              one. He said he was a reporter. I believed it for the moment.
              Wanted to know all he could about the Scowrers and what he called
              ‘the outrages’ for a New York paper. Asked me every kind of
              question so as to get something. You bet I was giving nothing
              away. ‘I'd pay for it and pay well,’ said he, ‘if I could get some
              stuff that would suit my editor.’ I said what I thought would
              please him best, and he handed me a twenty-dollar bill for my
              information. ‘There's ten times that for you,’ said he, ‘if you
              can find me all that I want.’”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“What did you tell him, then?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Any stuff I could make up.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“How do you know he wasn't a newspaper man?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I'll tell you. He got out at Hobson's Patch, and so did I. I
              chanced into the telegraph bureau, and he was leaving it.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “‘See here,’ said the operator after he'd gone out, ‘I guess we
              should charge double rates for this.’—‘I guess you should,’ said
              I. He had filled the form with stuff that might have been Chinese,
              for all we could make of it. ‘He fires a sheet of this off every
              day,’ said the clerk. ‘Yes,’ said I; ‘it's special news for his
              paper, and he's scared that the others should tap it.’ That was
              what the operator thought and what I thought at the time; but I
              think differently now.”

            <TextNode>
              “By Gar! I believe you are right,” said McGinty. “But what do you
              allow that we should do about it?”

            <TextNode>
              “Why not go right down now and fix him?” someone suggested.

            <TextNode>“Ay, the sooner the better.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I'd start this next minute if I knew where we could find him,”
              said McMurdo. “He's in Hobson's Patch; but I don't know the house.
              I've got a plan, though, if you'll only take my advice.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Well, what is it?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I'll go to the Patch to-morrow morning. I'll find him through the
              operator. He can locate him, I guess. Well, then I'll tell him
              that I'm a Freeman myself. I'll offer him all the secrets of the
              lodge for a price. You bet he'll tumble to it. I'll tell him the
              papers are at my house, and that it's as much as my life would be
              worth to let him come while folk were about. He'll see that that's
              horse sense. Let him come at ten o'clock at night, and he shall
              see everything. That will fetch him sure.”

            <TextNode>“Well?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “You can plan the rest for yourselves. Widow MacNamara's is a

              There's only Scanlan and me in the house. If I get his promise—and
              I'll let you know if I do—I'd have the whole seven of you come to
              me by nine o'clock. We'll get him in. If ever he gets out
