              With an effort Dr. Sterndale recovered his ruffled composure.

              “I have no objection to telling you,” he said. “It was Mr.

            <TextNode>
              “Thank you,” said Holmes. “I may say in answer to your original
              question that I have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject
              of this case, but that I have every hope of reaching some
              conclusion. It would be premature to say more.”

              “Then I have wasted my time and need not prolong my visit.” The
              famous doctor strode out of our cottage in considerable
              ill-humour, and within five minutes Holmes had followed him. I saw
              him no more until the evening, when he returned with a slow step
              and haggard face which assured me that he had made no great
              progress with his investigation. He glanced at a telegram which
              awaited him and threw it into the grate.

              “From the Plymouth hotel, Watson,” he said. “I learned the name of
              it from the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr. Leon
              Sterndale's account was true. It appears that he did indeed spend
              last night there, and that he has actually allowed some of his
              baggage to go on to Africa, while he returned to be present at
              this investigation. What do you make of that, Watson?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“He is deeply interested.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Deeply interested—yes. There is a thread here which we had not
              yet grasped and which might lead us through the tangle. Cheer up,
              Watson, for I am very sure that our material has not yet all come

              Little did I think how soon the words of Holmes would be realized,
              or how strange and sinister would be that new development which
              opened up an entirely fresh line of investigation. I was shaving
              at my window in the morning when I heard the rattle of hoofs and,
              looking up, saw a dog-cart coming at a gallop down the road. It
              pulled up at our door, and our friend, the vicar, sprang from it
              and rushed up our garden path. Holmes was already dressed, and we
              hastened down to meet him.

              “We are devil-ridden, Mr. Holmes! My poor parish is devil-ridden!”
              he cried. “Satan himself is loose in it! We are given over into
              his hands!” He danced about in his agitation, a ludicrous object
              if it were not for his ashy face and startled eyes. Finally he
              shot out his terrible news.

              “Mr. Mortimer Tregennis died during the night, and with exactly

              “Then, Watson, we will postpone our breakfast. Mr. Roundhay, we

              The lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage, which were in an
              angle by themselves, the one above the other. Below was a large
              sitting-room; above, his bedroom. They looked out upon a croquet
              lawn which came up to the windows. We had arrived before the
              doctor or the police, so that everything was absolutely
              undisturbed. Let me describe exactly the scene as we saw it upon
              that misty March morning. It has left an impression which can
              never be effaced from my mind.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              The atmosphere of the room was of a horrible and depressing
              stuffiness. The servant who had first entered had thrown up the
              window, or it would have been even more intolerable. This might
              partly be due to the fact that a lamp stood flaring and smoking on
              the centre table. Beside it sat the dead man, leaning back in his
              chair, his thin beard projecting, his spectacles pushed up on to
              his forehead, and his lean dark face turned towards the window and
              twisted into the same distortion of terror which had marked the
              features of his dead sister. His limbs were convulsed and his
              fingers contorted as though he had died in a very paroxysm of
              fear. He was fully clothed, though there were signs that his
              dressing had been done in a hurry. We had already learned that his
              bed had been slept in, and that the tragic end had come to him in
              the early morning.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              One realized the red-hot energy which underlay Holmes's phlegmatic
              exterior when one saw the sudden change which came over him from
              the moment that he entered the fatal apartment. In an instant he
              was tense and alert, his eyes shining, his face set, his limbs
              quivering with eager activity. He was out on the lawn, in through
              the window, round the room, and up into the bedroom, for all the
              world like a dashing foxhound drawing a cover. In the bedroom he
              made a rapid cast around and ended by throwing open the window,
              which appeared to give him some fresh cause for excitement, for he
              leaned out of it with loud ejaculations of interest and delight.
              Then he rushed down the stair, out through the open window, threw
              himself upon his face on the lawn, sprang up and into the room
              once more, all with the energy of the hunter who is at the very
              heels of his quarry. The lamp, which was an ordinary standard, he
              examined with minute care, making certain measurements upon its
              bowl. He carefully scrutinized with his lens the talc shield which
              covered the top of the chimney and scraped off some ashes which
              adhered to its upper surface, putting some of them into an
              envelope, which he placed in his pocketbook. Finally, just as the
              doctor and the official police put in an appearance, he beckoned
              to the vicar and we all three went out upon the lawn.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I am glad to say that my investigation has not been entirely
              barren,” he remarked. “I cannot remain to discuss the matter with
              the police, but I should be exceedingly obliged, Mr. Roundhay, if
              you would give the inspector my compliments and direct his
              attention to the bedroom window and to the sitting-room lamp. Each
              is suggestive, and together they are almost conclusive. If the
              police would desire further information I shall be happy to see
              any of them at the cottage. And now, Watson, I think that,
              perhaps, we shall be better employed elsewhere.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              It may be that the police resented the intrusion of an amateur, or
              that they imagined themselves to be upon some hopeful line of
              investigation; but it is certain that we heard nothing from them
              for the next two days. During this time Holmes spent some of his
              time smoking and dreaming in the cottage; but a greater portion in
              country walks which he undertook alone, returning after many hours
              without remark as to where he had been. One experiment served to
              show me the line of his investigation. He had bought a lamp which
              was the duplicate of the one which had burned in the room of
              Mortimer Tregennis on the morning of the tragedy. This he filled
              with the same oil as that used at the vicarage, and he carefully
              timed the period which it would take to be exhausted. Another
              experiment which he made was of a more unpleasant nature, and one
              which I am not likely ever to forget.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “You will remember, Watson,” he remarked one afternoon, “that
              there is a single common point of resemblance in the varying
              reports which have reached us. This concerns the effect of the
              atmosphere of the room in each case upon those who had first
              entered it. You will recollect that Mortimer Tregennis, in
              describing the episode of his last visit to his brother's house,
              remarked that the doctor on entering the room fell into a chair?
              You had forgotten? Well I can answer for it that it was so. Now,
              you will remember also that Mrs. Porter, the housekeeper, told us
              that she herself fainted upon entering the room and had afterwards
              opened the window. In the second case—that of Mortimer Tregennis
              himself—you cannot have forgotten the horrible stuffiness of the
              room when we arrived, though the servant had thrown open the
              window. That servant, I found upon inquiry, was so ill that she
              had gone to her bed. You will admit, Watson, that these facts are
              very suggestive. In each case there is evidence of a poisonous
              atmosphere. In each case, also, there is combustion going on in
              the room—in the one case a fire, in the other a lamp. The fire was
              needed, but the lamp was lit—as a comparison of the oil consumed
              will show—long after it was broad daylight. Why? Surely because
              there is some connection between three things—the burning, the
              stuffy atmosphere, and, finally, the madness or death of those
              unfortunate people. That is clear, is it not?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“It would appear so.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “At least we may accept it as a working hypothesis. We will
              suppose, then, that something was burned in each case which
              produced an atmosphere causing strange toxic effects. Very good.
              In the first instance—that of the Tregennis family—this substance
              was placed in the fire. Now the window was shut, but the fire
              would naturally carry fumes to some extent up the chimney. Hence
              one would expect the effects of the poison to be less than in the
              second case, where there was less escape for the vapour. The
              result seems to indicate that it was so, since in the first case
              only the woman, who had presumably the more sensitive organism,
              was killed, the others exhibiting that temporary or permanent
              lunacy which is evidently the first effect of the drug. In the
              second case the result was complete. The facts, therefore, seem to
              bear out the theory of a poison which worked by combustion.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “With this train of reasoning in my head I naturally looked about
              in Mortimer Tregennis's room to find some remains of this
              substance. The obvious place to look was the talc shelf or
              smoke-guard of the lamp. There, sure enough, I perceived a number
              of flaky ashes, and round the edges a fringe of brownish powder,
              which had not yet been consumed. Half of this I took, as you saw,
              and I placed it in an envelope.”

              “It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in the way of the
              official police force. I leave them all the evidence which I
              found. The poison still remained upon the talc had they the wit to
              find it. Now, Watson, we will light our lamp; we will, however,
              take the precaution to open our window to avoid the premature
              decease of two deserving members of society, and you will seat
              yourself near that open window in an armchair unless, like a
              sensible man, you determine to have nothing to do with the affair.
              Oh, you will see it out, will you? I thought I knew my Watson.
              This chair I will place opposite yours, so that we may be the same
              distance from the poison and face to face. The door we will leave
              ajar. Each is now in a position to watch the other and to bring
              the experiment to an end should the symptoms seem alarming. Is
              that all clear? Well, then, I take our powder—or what remains of
              it—from the envelope, and I lay it above the burning lamp. So!
              Now, Watson, let us sit down and await developments.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              They were not long in coming. I had hardly settled in my chair
              before I was conscious of a thick, musky odour, subtle and
              nauseous. At the very first whiff of it my brain and my
              imagination were beyond all control. A thick, black cloud swirled
              before my eyes, and my mind told me that in this cloud, unseen as
              yet, but about to spring out upon my appalled senses, lurked all
              that was vaguely horrible, all that was monstrous and
              inconceivably wicked in the universe. Vague shapes swirled and
              swam amid the dark cloud-bank, each a menace and a warning of
              something coming, the advent of some unspeakable dweller upon the
              threshold, whose very shadow would blast my soul. A freezing
              horror took possession of me. I felt that my hair was rising, that
              my eyes were protruding, that my mouth was opened, and my tongue
              like leather. The turmoil within my brain was such that something
              must surely snap. I tried to scream and was vaguely aware of some
              hoarse croak which was my own voice, but distant and detached from
              myself. At the same moment, in some effort of escape, I broke
              through that cloud of despair and had a glimpse of Holmes's face,
              white, rigid, and drawn with horror—the very look which I had seen
              upon the features of the dead. It was that vision which gave me an
              instant of sanity and of strength. I dashed from my chair, threw
              my arms round Holmes, and together we lurched through the door,
              and an instant afterwards had thrown ourselves down upon the grass
              plot and were lying side by side, conscious only of the glorious
              sunshine which was bursting its way through the hellish cloud of
              terror which had girt us in. Slowly it rose from our souls like
              the mists from a landscape until peace and reason had returned,
              and we were sitting upon the grass, wiping our clammy foreheads,
              and looking with apprehension at each other to mark the last
              traces of that terrific experience which we had undergone.

              “Upon my word, Watson!” said Holmes at last with an unsteady
              voice, “I owe you both my thanks and an apology. It was an
              unjustifiable experiment even for one's self, and doubly so for a
              friend. I am really very sorry.”

            <TextNode>
              “You know,” I answered with some emotion, for I have never seen so
              much of Holmes's heart before, “that it is my greatest joy and
              privilege to help you.”

            <TextNode>
              He relapsed at once into the half-humorous, half-cynical vein
              which was his habitual attitude to those about him. “It would be
              superfluous to drive us mad, my dear Watson,” said he. “A candid
              observer would certainly declare that we were so already before we
              embarked upon so wild an experiment. I confess that I never
              imagined that the effect could be so sudden and so severe.” He
              dashed into the cottage, and, reappearing with the burning lamp
              held at full arm's length, he threw it among a bank of brambles.
              “We must give the room a little time to clear. I take it, Watson,
              that you have no longer a shadow of a doubt as to how these
              tragedies were produced?”

              “But the cause remains as obscure as before. Come into the arbour
              here and let us discuss it together. That villainous stuff seems
              still to linger round my throat. I think we must admit that all
              the evidence points to this man, Mortimer Tregennis, having been
              the criminal in the first tragedy, though he was the victim in the
              second one. We must remember, in the first place, that there is
              some story of a family quarrel, followed by a reconciliation. How
              bitter that quarrel may have been, or how hollow the
              reconciliation we cannot tell. When I think of Mortimer Tregennis,
              with the foxy face and the small shrewd, beady eyes behind the
              spectacles, he is not a man whom I should judge to be of a
              particularly forgiving disposition. Well, in the next place, you
              will remember that this idea of someone moving in the garden,
              which took our attention for a moment from the real cause of the
              tragedy, emanated from him. He had a motive in misleading us.
              Finally, if he did not throw the substance into the fire at the
              moment of leaving the room, who did do so? The affair happened
              immediately after his departure. Had anyone else come in, the
              family would certainly have risen from the table. Besides, in
              peaceful Cornwall, visitors did not arrive after ten o'clock at
              night. We may take it, then, that all the evidence points to
              Mortimer Tregennis as the culprit.”

              “Well, Watson, it is on the face of it a not impossible
              supposition. The man who had the guilt upon his soul of having
              brought such a fate upon his own family might well be driven by
              remorse to inflict it upon himself. There are, however, some
              cogent reasons against it. Fortunately, there is one man in
              England who knows all about it, and I have made arrangements by
              which we shall hear the facts this afternoon from his own lips.
              Ah! he is a little before his time. Perhaps you would kindly step
              this way, Dr. Leon Sterndale. We have been conducing a chemical
              experiment indoors which has left our little room hardly fit for
              the reception of so distinguished a visitor.”

              I had heard the click of the garden gate, and now the majestic
              figure of the great African explorer appeared upon the path. He
              turned in some surprise towards the rustic arbour in which we sat.

              “You sent for me, Mr. Holmes. I had your note about an hour ago,

              your summons.”

              “Perhaps we can clear the point up before we separate,” said
              Holmes. “Meanwhile, I am much obliged to you for your courteous
              acquiescence. You will excuse this informal reception in the open
              air, but my friend Watson and I have nearly furnished an
              additional chapter to what the papers call the Cornish Horror, and
              we prefer a clear atmosphere for the present. Perhaps, since the
              matters which we have to discuss will affect you personally in a
              very intimate fashion, it is as well that we should talk where
              there can be no eavesdropping.”

              The explorer took his cigar from his lips and gazed sternly at my

              “I am at a loss to know, sir,” he said, “what you can have to

              For a moment I wished that I were armed. Sterndale's fierce face
              turned to a dusky red, his eyes glared, and the knotted,
              passionate veins started out in his forehead, while he sprang
              forward with clenched hands towards my companion. Then he stopped,
              and with a violent effort he resumed a cold, rigid calmness, which
              was, perhaps, more suggestive of danger than his hot-headed
              outburst.

              “I have lived so long among savages and beyond the law,” said he,
              “that I have got into the way of being a law to myself. You would
              do well, Mr. Holmes, not to forget it, for I have no desire to do
              you an injury.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Nor have I any desire to do you an injury, Dr. Sterndale. Surely
              the clearest proof of it is that, knowing what I know, I have sent
              for you and not for the police.”

              Sterndale sat down with a gasp, overawed for, perhaps, the first
              time in his adventurous life. There was a calm assurance of power
              in Holmes's manner which could not be withstood. Our visitor
              stammered for a moment, his great hands opening and shutting in
              his agitation.

              “What do you mean?” he asked at last. “If this is bluff upon your
              part, Mr. Holmes, you have chosen a bad man for your experiment.
              Let us have no more beating about the bush. What do you mean?”

              “I will tell you,” said Holmes, “and the reason why I tell you is
              that I hope frankness may beget frankness. What my next step may
              be will depend entirely upon the nature of your own defence.”

              Sterndale mopped his forehead with his handkerchief. “Upon my
              word, you are getting on,” said he. “Do all your successes depend
              upon this prodigious power of bluff?”

            <TextNode>
              “The bluff,” said Holmes sternly, “is upon your side, Dr. Leon
              Sterndale, and not upon mine. As a proof I will tell you some of
              the facts upon which my conclusions are based. Of your return from
              Plymouth, allowing much of your property to go on to Africa, I
              will say nothing save that it first informed me that you were one
              of the factors which had to be taken into account in
              reconstructing this drama—”

            <TextNode>
              “I have heard your reasons and regard them as unconvincing and
              inadequate. We will pass that. You came down here to ask me whom I
              suspected. I refused to answer you. You then went to the vicarage,
              waited outside it for some time, and finally returned to your
              cottage.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“How do you know that?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“I followed you.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“I saw no one.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “That is what you may expect to see when I follow you. You spent a
              restless night at your cottage, and you formed certain plans,
              which in the early morning you proceeded to put into execution.
              Leaving your door just as day was breaking, you filled your pocket
              with some reddish gravel that was lying heaped beside your gate.”

              Sterndale gave a violent start and looked at Holmes in amazement.

              “You then walked swiftly for the mile which separated you from the
              vicarage. You were wearing, I may remark, the same pair of ribbed
              tennis shoes which are at the present moment upon your feet. At
              the vicarage you passed through the orchard and the side hedge,
              coming out under the window of the lodger Tregennis. It was now
              daylight, but the household was not yet stirring. You drew some of
              the gravel from your pocket, and you threw it up at the window
              above you.”
