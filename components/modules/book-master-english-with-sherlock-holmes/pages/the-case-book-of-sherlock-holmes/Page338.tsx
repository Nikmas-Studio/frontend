              Sherlock Holmes had been bending for a long time over a low-power
              microscope. Now he straightened himself up and looked round at me
              in triumph.

              “It is a very fine demonstration,” he answered. “In the St.
              Pancras case you may remember that a cap was found beside the dead
              policeman. The accused man denies that it is his. But he is a

              in the seam of his cuff they have begun to realize the importance
              of the microscope.” He looked impatiently at his watch. “I had a

              years back. He is one of those men who have overshot their true
              generation. He should have been a buck in the days of the
              Regency—a boxer, an athlete, a plunger on the turf, a lover of

              The door had opened and the page had shown in a tall, clean-shaven
              man with the firm, austere expression which is only seen upon
              those who have to control horses or boys. Mr. John Mason had many
              of both under his sway, and he looked equal to the task. He bowed
              with cold self-possession and seated himself upon the chair to
              which Holmes had waved him.

              Holmes raised his eyebrows. “This is Baker Street, not Harley

            <TextNode>
              “Well, sir, when a man does one queer thing, or two queer things,
              there may be a meaning to it, but when everything he does is
              queer, then you begin to wonder. I believe Shoscombe Prince and
              the Derby have turned his brain.”

              “The best in England, Mr. Holmes. I should know, if anyone does.
              Now, I'll be plain with you, for I know you are gentlemen of
              honour and that it won't go beyond the room. Sir Robert has got to
              win this Derby. He's up to the neck, and it's his last chance.
              Everything he could raise or borrow is on the horse—and at fine
              odds, too! You can get forties now, but it was nearer the hundred
              when he began to back him.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“But how is that if the horse is so good?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “The public don't know how good he is. Sir Robert has been too
              clever for the touts. He has the Prince's half-brother out for
              spins. You can't tell 'em apart. But there are two lengths in a
              furlong between them when it comes to a gallop. He thinks of
              nothing but the horse and the race. His whole life is on it. He's
              holding off the Jews till then. If the Prince fails him he is
              done.”

            <TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, first of all, you have only to look at him. I don't believe
              he sleeps at night. He is down at the stables at all hours. His
              eyes are wild. It has all been too much for his nerves. Then there
              is his conduct to Lady Beatrice!”

            <TextNode>“Ah! What is that?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “They have always been the best of friends. They had the same
              tastes, the two of them, and she loved the horses as much as he
              did. Every day at the same hour she would drive down to see
              them—and, above all, she loved the Prince. He would prick up his
              ears when he heard the wheels on the gravel, and he would trot out
              each morning to the carriage to get his lump of sugar. But that's
              all over now.”

            <TextNode>“Why?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, she seems to have lost all interest in the horses. For a
              week now she has driven past the stables with never so much as
              ‘Good-morning’!”

            <TextNode>“You think there has been a quarrel?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “And a bitter, savage, spiteful quarrel at that. Why else would he
              give away her pet spaniel that she loved as if he were her child?
              He gave it a few days ago to old Barnes, what keeps the Green
              Dragon, three miles off, at Crendall.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“That certainly did seem strange.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Of course, with her weak heart and dropsy one couldn't expect
              that she could get about with him, but he spent two hours every
              evening in her room. He might well do what he could, for she has
              been a rare good friend to him. But that's all over, too. He never
              goes near her. And she takes it to heart. She is brooding and
              sulky and drinking, Mr. Holmes—drinking like a fish.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Did she drink before this estrangement?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, she took her glass, but now it is often a whole bottle of
              an evening. So Stephens, the butler, told me. It's all changed,
              Mr. Holmes, and there is something damned rotten about it. But
              then, again, what is master doing down at the old church crypt at
              night? And who is the man that meets him there?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>Holmes rubbed his hands.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Go on, Mr. Mason. You get more and more interesting.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “It was the butler who saw him go. Twelve o'clock at night and
              raining hard. So next night I was up at the house and, sure
              enough, master was off again. Stephens and I went after him, but
              it was jumpy work, for it would have been a bad job if he had seen
              us. He's a terrible man with his fists if he gets started, and no
              respecter of persons. So we were shy of getting too near, but we
              marked him down all right. It was the haunted crypt that he was
              making for, and there was a man waiting for him there.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“What is this haunted crypt?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, sir, there is an old ruined chapel in the park. It is so
              old that nobody could fix its date. And under it there's a crypt
              which has a bad name among us. It's a dark, damp, lonely place by
              day, but there are few in that county that would have the nerve to
              go near it at night. But master's not afraid. He never feared
              anything in his life. But what is he doing there in the
              night-time?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Wait a bit!” said Holmes. “You say there is another man there. It
              must be one of your own stablemen, or someone from the house!
              Surely you have only to spot who it is and question him?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“It's no one I know.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“How can you say that?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Because I have seen him, Mr. Holmes. It was on that second night.
              Sir Robert turned and passed us—me and Stephens, quaking in the
              bushes like two bunny-rabbits, for there was a bit of moon that
              night. But we could hear the other moving about behind. We were
              not afraid of him. So we up when Sir Robert was gone and pretended
              we were just having a walk like in the moonlight, and so we came
              right on him as casual and innocent as you please. ‘Hullo, mate!
              who may you be?’ says I. I guess he had not heard us coming, so he
              looked over his shoulder with a face as if he had seen the devil
              coming out of hell. He let out a yell, and away he went as hard as
              he could lick it in the darkness. He could run!—I'll give him
              that. In a minute he was out of sight and hearing, and who he was,
              or what he was, we never found.”

            <TextNode>Holmes sat for some time lost in thought.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>

            <TextNode>“And is, no doubt, devoted?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>Mr. Mason shuffled uncomfortably.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “She's devoted enough,” he answered at last. “But I won't say to

            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Ah!” said Holmes.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“I can't tell tales out of school.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I quite understand, Mr. Mason. Of course, the situation is clear
              enough. From Dr. Watson's description of Sir Robert I can realize
              that no woman is safe from him. Don't you think the quarrel
              between brother and sister may lie there?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, the scandal has been pretty clear for a long time.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “But she may not have seen it before. Let us suppose that she has
              suddenly found it out. She wants to get rid of the woman. Her
              brother will not permit it. The invalid, with her weak heart and
              inability to get about, has no means of enforcing her will. The
              hated maid is still tied to her. The lady refuses to speak, sulks,
              takes to drink. Sir Robert in his anger takes her pet spaniel away
              from her. Does not all this hang together?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Well, it might do—so far as it goes.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Exactly! As far as it goes. How would all that bear upon the
              visits by night to the old crypt? We can't fit that into our

            <TextNode>
              “No, sir, and there is something more that I can't fit in. Why

            <TextNode>Holmes sat up abruptly.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “We only found it out yesterday—after I had written to you.
              Yesterday Sir Robert had gone to London, so Stephens and I went
              down to the crypt. It was all in order, sir, except that in one

              “Well, sir, I think it would hardly interest them. It was just the
              head and a few bones of a mummy. It may have been a thousand years
              old. But it wasn't there before. That I'll swear, and so will
              Stephens. It had been stowed away in a corner and covered over
              with a board, but that corner had always been empty before.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“What did you do with it?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Well, we just left it there.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “That was wise. You say Sir Robert was away yesterday. Has he
              returned?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“We expect him back to-day.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “When did Sir Robert give away his sister's dog?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “It was just a week ago to-day. The creature was howling outside
              the old well-house, and Sir Robert was in one of his tantrums that
              morning. He caught it up, and I thought he would have killed it.
              Then he gave it to Sandy Bain, the jockey, and told him to take
              the dog to old Barnes at the Green Dragon, for he never wished to
              see it again.”

              Holmes sat for some time in silent thought. He had lit the oldest
              and foulest of his pipes.

            <TextNode>
              “I am not clear yet what you want me to do in this matter, Mr.
              Mason,” he said at last. “Can't you make it more definite?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Perhaps this will make it more definite, Mr. Holmes,” said our
              visitor.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              He took a paper from his pocket, and, unwrapping it carefully, he
              exposed a charred fragment of bone.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>Holmes examined it with interest.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Where did you get it?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “There is a central heating furnace in the cellar under Lady
              Beatrice's room. It's been off for some time, but Sir Robert
              complained of cold and had it on again. Harvey runs it—he's one of
              my lads. This very morning he came to me with this which he found
              raking out the cinders. He didn't like the look of it.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Nor do I,” said Holmes. “What do you make of it, Watson?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              It was burned to a black cinder, but there could be no question as
              to its anatomical significance.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “It's the upper condyle of a human femur,” said I.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Exactly!” Holmes had become very serious. “When does this lad
              tend to the furnace?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “He makes it up every evening and then leaves it.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Then anyone could visit it during the night?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Yes, sir.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Can you enter it from outside?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “There is one door from outside. There is another which leads up
              by a stair to the passage in which Lady Beatrice's room is
              situated.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “These are deep waters, Mr. Mason; deep and rather dirty. You say
              that Sir Robert was not at home last night?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“No, sir.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Then, whoever was burning bones, it was not he.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“That's true, sir.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“What is the name of that inn you spoke of?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“The Green Dragon.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Is there good fishing in that part of Berkshire?” The honest
              trainer showed very clearly upon his face that he was convinced
              that yet another lunatic had come into his harassed life.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, sir, I've heard there are trout in the mill-stream and pike
              in the Hall lake.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “That's good enough. Watson and I are famous fishermen—are we not,
              Watson? You may address us in future at the Green Dragon. We
              should reach it to-night. I need not say that we don't want to see
              you, Mr. Mason, but a note will reach us, and no doubt I could
              find you if I want you. When we have gone a little farther into
              the matter I will let you have a considered opinion.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              Thus it was that on a bright May evening Holmes and I found
              ourselves alone in a first-class carriage and bound for the little
              “halt-on-demand” station of Shoscombe. The rack above us was
              covered with a formidable litter of rods, reels, and baskets. On
              reaching our destination a short drive took us to an old-fashioned
              tavern, where a sporting host, Josiah Barnes, entered eagerly into
              our plans for the extirpation of the fish of the neighbourhood.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “What about the Hall lake and the chance of a pike?” said Holmes.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>The face of the innkeeper clouded.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “That wouldn't do, sir. You might chance to find yourself in the
              lake before you were through.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“How's that, then?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “It's Sir Robert, sir. He's terrible jealous of touts. If you two
              strangers were as near his training quarters as that he'd be after
              you as sure as fate. He ain't taking no chances, Sir Robert
              ain't.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I've heard he has a horse entered for the Derby.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Yes, and a good colt, too. He carries all our money for the race,
              and all Sir Robert's into the bargain. By the way”—he looked at us
              with thoughtful eyes—“I suppose you ain't on the turf yourselves?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “No, indeed. Just two weary Londoners who badly need some good
              Berkshire air.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, you are in the right place for that. There is a deal of it
              lying about. But mind what I have told you about Sir Robert. He's
              the sort that strikes first and speaks afterwards. Keep clear of
              the park.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Surely, Mr. Barnes! We certainly shall. By the way, that was a
              most beautiful spaniel that was whining in the hall.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I should say it was. That was the real Shoscombe breed. There
              ain't a better in England.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I am a dog-fancier myself,” said Holmes. “Now, if it is a fair
              question, what would a prize dog like that cost?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “More than I could pay, sir. It was Sir Robert himself who gave me
              this one. That's why I have to keep it on a lead. It would be off
              to the Hall in a jiffy if I gave it its head.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “We are getting some cards in our hand, Watson,” said Holmes when
              the landlord had left us. “It's not an easy one to play, but we
              may see our way in a day or two. By the way, Sir Robert is still
              in London, I hear. We might, perhaps, enter the sacred domain
              to-night without fear of bodily assault. There are one or two
              points on which I should like reassurance.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Have you any theory, Holmes?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Only this, Watson, that something happened a week or so ago which
              has cut deep into the life of the Shoscombe household. What is
              that something? We can only guess at it from its effects. They
              seem to be of a curiously mixed character. But that should surely
              help us. It is only the colourless, uneventful case which is
              hopeless.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Let us consider our data. The brother no longer visits the
              beloved invalid sister. He gives away her favourite dog. Her dog,
              Watson! Does that suggest nothing to you?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Nothing but the brother's spite.”</TextNode>
            <TextNode>
              “Well, it might be so. Or—well, there is an alternative. Now to
              continue our review of the situation from the time that the
              quarrel, if there is a quarrel, began. The lady keeps her room,
              alters her habits, is not seen save when she drives out with her
              maid, refuses to stop at the stables to greet her favourite horse,
              and apparently takes to drink. That covers the case, does it not?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Save for the business in the crypt.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “That is another line of thought. There are two, and I beg you
              will not tangle them. Line A, which concerns Lady Beatrice, has a
              vaguely sinister flavour, has it not?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“I can make nothing of it.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, now, let us take up line B, which concerns Sir Robert. He
              is mad keen upon winning the Derby. He is in the hands of the
              Jews, and may at any moment be sold up and his racing stables
              seized by his creditors. He is a daring and desperate man. He
              derives his income from his sister. His sister's maid is his
              willing tool. So far we seem to be on fairly safe ground, do we
              not?”
