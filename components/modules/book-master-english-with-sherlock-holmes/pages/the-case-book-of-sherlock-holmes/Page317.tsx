              I don't think that any of my adventures with Mr. Sherlock Holmes
              opened quite so abruptly, or so dramatically, as that which I
              associate with The Three Gables. I had not seen Holmes for some
              days and had no idea of the new channel into which his activities
              had been directed. He was in a chatty mood that morning, however,
              and had just settled me into the well-worn low armchair on one
              side of the fire, while he had curled down with his pipe in his
              mouth upon the opposite chair, when our visitor arrived. If I had
              said that a mad bull had arrived it would give a clearer
              impression of what occurred.

              The door had flown open and a huge negro had burst into the room.
              He would have been a comic figure if he had not been terrific, for
              he was dressed in a very loud gray check suit with a flowing
              salmon-coloured tie. His broad face and flattened nose were thrust
              forward, as his sullen dark eyes, with a smouldering gleam of
              malice in them, turned from one of us to the other.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Which of you gen'l'men is Masser Holmes?” he asked.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>Holmes raised his pipe with a languid smile.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Oh! it's you, is it?” said our visitor, coming with an
              unpleasant, stealthy step round the angle of the table. “See here,
              Masser Holmes, you keep your hands out of other folks' business.
              Leave folks to manage their own affairs. Got that, Masser Holmes?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Keep on talking,” said Holmes. “It's fine.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Oh! it's fine, is it?” growled the savage. “It won't be so damn
              fine if I have to trim you up a bit. I've handled your kind before
              now, and they didn't look fine when I was through with them. Look
              at that, Masser Holmes!”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              He swung a huge knotted lump of a fist under my friend's nose.
              Holmes examined it closely with an air of great interest. “Were
              you born so?” he asked. “Or did it come by degrees?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              It may have been the icy coolness of my friend, or it may have
              been the slight clatter which I made as I picked up the poker. In
              any case, our visitor's manner became less flamboyant.

            <TextNode>
              “Well, I've given you fair warnin',” said he. “I've a friend
              that's interested out Harrow way—you know what I'm meaning—and he
              don't intend to have no buttin' in by you. Got that? You ain't the
              law, and I ain't the law either, and if you come in I'll be on
              hand also. Don't you forget it.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I've wanted to meet you for some time,” said Holmes. “I won't ask
              you to sit down, for I don't like the smell of you, but aren't you
              Steve Dixie, the bruiser?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “That's my name, Masser Holmes, and you'll get put through it for
              sure if you give me any lip.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “It is certainly the last thing you need,” said Holmes, staring at
              our visitor's hideous mouth. “But it was the killing of young
              Perkins outside the Holborn Bar— What! you're not going?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              The negro had sprung back, and his face was leaden. “I won't
              listen to no such talk,” said he. “What have I to do with this
              'ere Perkins, Masser Holmes? I was trainin' at the Bull Ring in
              Birmingham when this boy done gone get into trouble.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Yes, you'll tell the magistrate about it, Steve,” said Holmes.
              “I've been watching you and Barney Stockdale—”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“So help me the Lord! Masser Holmes—”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “That's enough. Get out of it. I'll pick you up when I want you.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Good-mornin', Masser Holmes. I hope there ain't no hard feelin's
              about this 'ere visit?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “There will be unless you tell me who sent you.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Why, there ain't no secret about that, Masser Holmes. It was that
              same gen'l'man that you have just done gone mention.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“And who set him on to it?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “S'elp me. I don't know, Masser Holmes. He just say, ‘Steve, you
              go see Mr. Holmes, and tell him his life ain't safe if he go down
              Harrow way.’ That's the whole truth.” Without waiting for any
              further questioning, our visitor bolted out of the room almost as
              precipitately as he had entered. Holmes knocked out the ashes of
              his pipe with a quiet chuckle.

              “I am glad you were not forced to break his woolly head, Watson. I
              observed your manoeuvres with the poker. But he is really rather a
              harmless fellow, a great muscular, foolish, blustering baby, and
              easily cowed, as you have seen. He is one of the Spencer John gang
              and has taken part in some dirty work of late which I may clear up
              when I have time. His immediate principal, Barney, is a more
              astute person. They specialize in assaults, intimidation, and the

                I have had a succession of strange incidents occur to me in
                connection with this house, and I should much value your advice.
                You would find me at home any time to-morrow. The house is
                within a short walk of the Weald Station. I believe that my late
                husband, Mortimer Maberley, was one of your early clients.

              A short railway journey, and a shorter drive, brought us to the
              house, a brick and timber villa, standing in its own acre of
              undeveloped grassland. Three small projections above the upper
              windows made a feeble attempt to justify its name. Behind was a
              grove of melancholy, half-grown pines, and the whole aspect of the
              place was poor and depressing. None the less, we found the house
              to be well furnished, and the lady who received us was a most
              engaging elderly person, who bore every mark of refinement and
              culture.

              morose, brooding creature into which he developed. His heart was

              “There have been some very strange happenings. I have been in this
              house more than a year now, and as I wished to lead a retired life
              I have seen little of my neighbours. Three days ago I had a call
              from a man who said that he was a house agent. He said that this
              house would exactly suit a client of his, and that if I would part
              with it money would be no object. It seemed to me very strange as
              there are several empty houses on the market which appear to be
              equally eligible, but naturally I was interested in what he said.
              I therefore named a price which was five hundred pounds more than
              I gave. He at once closed with the offer, but added that his
              client desired to buy the furniture as well and would I put a
              price upon it. Some of this furniture is from my old home, and it
              is, as you see, very good, so that I named a good round sum. To
              this also he at once agreed. I had always wanted to travel, and
              the bargain was so good a one that it really seemed that I should
              be my own mistress for the rest of my life.

              Luckily I showed it to Mr. Sutro, my lawyer, who lives in Harrow.
              He said to me, ‘This is a very strange document. Are you aware
              that if you sign it you could not legally take anything out of the
              house—not even your own private possessions?’ When the man came
              again in the evening I pointed this out, and I said that I meant
              only to sell the furniture.

              Look how close they play the game. Your letter to me had the&nbsp;
              <span className='italic'>10 P. M.</span> postmark. And yet Susan
              passes the word to Barney. Barney has time to go to his employer
              and get instructions; he or she—I incline to the latter from
              Susan's grin when she thought I had blundered—forms a plan. Black
              Steve is called in, and I am warned off by eleven o'clock next
              morning. That's quick work, you know.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“But what do they want?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Yes, that's the question. Who had the house before you?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“A retired sea captain called Ferguson.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Anything remarkable about him?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Not that ever I heard of.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I was wondering whether he could have buried something. Of
              course, when people bury treasure nowadays they do it in the
              Post-Office bank. But there are always some lunatics about. It
              would be a dull world without them. At first I thought of some
              buried valuable. But why, in that case, should they want your
              furniture? You don't happen to have a Raphael or a first folio
              Shakespeare without knowing it?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “No, I don't think I have anything rarer than a Crown Derby
              tea-set.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “That would hardly justify all this mystery. Besides, why should
              they not openly state what they want? If they covet your tea-set,
              they can surely offer a price for it without buying you out, lock,
              stock, and barrel. No, as I read it, there is something which you
              do not know that you have, and which you would not give up if you
              did know.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“That is how I read it,” said I.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Dr. Watson agrees, so that settles it.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Well, Mr. Holmes, what can it be?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Let us see whether by this purely mental analysis we can get it
              to a finer point. You have been in this house a year.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Nearly two.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “All the better. During this long period no one wants anything
              from you. Now suddenly within three or four days you have urgent
              demands. What would you gather from that?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “It can only mean,” said I, “that the object, whatever it may be,
              has only just come into the house.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Settled once again,” said Holmes. “Now, Mrs. Maberley, has any
              object just arrived?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“No, I have bought nothing new this year.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Indeed! That is very remarkable. Well, I think we had best let
              matters develop a little further until we have clearer data. Is
              that lawyer of yours a capable man?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Mr. Sutro is most capable.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Have you another maid, or was the fair Susan, who has just banged
              your front door, alone?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“I have a young girl.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Try and get Sutro to spend a night or two in the house. You might
              possibly want protection.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Against whom?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Who knows? The matter is certainly obscure. If I can't find what
              they are after, I must approach the matter from the other end and
              try to get at the principal. Did this house-agent man give any
              address?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Simply his card and occupation. Haines-Johnson, Auctioneer and
              Valuer.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I don't think we shall find him in the directory. Honest business
              men don't conceal their place of business. Well, you will let me
              know any fresh development. I have taken up your case, and you may
              rely upon it that I shall see it through.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              As we passed through the hall Holmes's eyes, which missed nothing,
              lighted upon several trunks and cases which were piled in a
              corner. The labels shone out upon them.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“ ‘Milano.’ ‘Lucerne.’ These are from Italy.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“They are poor Douglas's things.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “You have not unpacked them? How long have you had them?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“They arrived last week.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “But you said—why, surely this might be the missing link. How do
              we know that there is not something of value there?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “There could not possibly be, Mr. Holmes. Poor Douglas had only
              his pay and a small annuity. What could he have of value?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>Holmes was lost in thought.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Delay no longer, Mrs. Maberley,” he said at last. “Have these
              things taken upstairs to your bedroom. Examine them as soon as
              possible and see what they contain. I will come to-morrow and hear
              your report.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              It was quite evident that The Three Gables was under very close
              surveillance, for as we came round the high hedge at the end of
              the lane there was the negro prize-fighter standing in the shadow.
              We came on him quite suddenly, and a grim and menacing figure he
              looked in that lonely place. Holmes clapped his hand to his
              pocket.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Lookin' for your gun, Masser Holmes?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“No, for my scent-bottle, Steve.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“You are funny, Masser Holmes, ain't you?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “It won't be funny for you, Steve, if I get after you. I gave you
              fair warning this morning.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, Masser Holmes, I done gone think over what you said, and I
              don't want no more talk about that affair of Masser Perkins.
              S'pose I can help you, Masser Holmes, I will.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, then, tell me who is behind you on this job.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “So help me the Lord! Masser Holmes, I told you the truth before.
              I don't know. My boss Barney gives me orders and that's all.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, just bear in mind, Steve, that the lady in that house, and
              everything under that roof, is under my protection. Don't forget
              it.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“All right, Masser Holmes. I'll remember.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I've got him thoroughly frightened for his own skin, Watson,”
              Holmes remarked as we walked on. “I think he would double-cross
              his employer if he knew who he was. It was lucky I had some
              knowledge of the Spencer John crowd, and that Steve was one of
              them. Now, Watson, this is a case for Langdale Pike, and I am
              going to see him now. When I get back I may be clearer in the
              matter.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              I saw no more of Holmes during the day, but I could well imagine
              how he spent it, for Langdale Pike was his human book of reference
              upon all matters of social scandal. This strange, languid creature
              spent his waking hours in the bow window of a St. James's Street
              club and was the receiving-station as well as the transmitter for
              all the gossip of the metropolis. He made, it was said, a
              four-figure income by the paragraphs which he contributed every
              week to the garbage papers which cater to an inquisitive public.
              If ever, far down in the turbid depths of London life, there was
              some strange swirl or eddy, it was marked with automatic exactness
              by this human dial upon the surface. Holmes discreetly helped
              Langdale to knowledge, and on occasion was helped in turn.

              When I met my friend in his room early next morning, I was
              conscious from his bearing that all was well, but none the less a
              most unpleasant surprise was awaiting us. It took the shape of the
              following telegram:
            </TextNode>

            <Indent>
              <TextNode noIndent>
                Please come out at once. Client's house burgled in the night.
                Police in possession.

              <TextNode noIndent className='italic'>
                — Sutro.

            </Indent>

            <TextNode noIndent>
              Holmes whistled. “The drama has come to a crisis, and quicker than
              I had expected. There is a great driving-power at the back of this
              business, Watson, which does not surprise me after what I have
              heard. This Sutro, of course, is her lawyer. I made a mistake, I
              fear, in not asking you to spend the night on guard. This fellow
              has clearly proved a broken reed. Well, there is nothing for it
              but another journey to Harrow Weald.”
