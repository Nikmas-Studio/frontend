              “No? Now, be reasonable, Count. Consider the situation. You are
              going to be locked up for twenty years. So is Sam Merton. What
              good are you going to get out of your diamond? None in the world.
              But if you hand it over—well, I'll compound a felony. We don't
              want you or Sam. We want the stone. Give that up, and so far as I
              am concerned you can go free so long as you behave yourself in the
              future. If you make another slip—well, it will be the last. But
              this time my commission is to get the stone, not you.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“But if I refuse?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Why, then—alas!—it must be you and not the stone.”

            <TextNode>Billy had appeared in answer to a ring.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I think, Count, that it would be as well to have your friend Sam
              at this conference. After all, his interests should be
              represented. Billy, you will see a large and ugly gentleman
              outside the front door. Ask him to come up.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“If he won't come, sir?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “No violence, Billy. Don't be rough with him. If you tell him that
              Count Sylvius wants him he will certainly come.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “What are you going to do now?” asked the Count as Billy
              disappeared.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “My friend Watson was with me just now. I told him that I had a
              shark and a gudgeon in my net; now I am drawing the net and up
              they come together.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              The Count had risen from his chair, and his hand was behind his
              back. Holmes held something half protruding from the pocket of his
              dressing-gown.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“You won't die in your bed, Holmes.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I have often had the same idea. Does it matter very much? After
              all, Count, your own exit is more likely to be perpendicular than
              horizontal. But these anticipations of the future are morbid. Why
              not give ourselves up to the unrestrained enjoyment of the
              present?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              A sudden wild-beast light sprang up in the dark, menacing eyes of
              the master criminal. Holmes's figure seemed to grow taller as he
              grew tense and ready.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “It is no use your fingering your revolver, my friend,” he said in
              a quiet voice. “You know perfectly well that you dare not use it,
              even if I gave you time to draw it. Nasty, noisy things,
              revolvers, Count. Better stick to air-guns. Ah! I think I hear the
              fairy footstep of your estimable partner. Good day, Mr. Merton.
              Rather dull in the street, is it not?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              The prize-fighter, a heavily built young man with a stupid,
              obstinate, slab-sided face, stood awkwardly at the door, looking
              about him with a puzzled expression. Holmes's debonair manner was
              a new experience, and though he vaguely felt that it was hostile,
              he did not know how to counter it. He turned to his more astute
              comrade for help.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “What's the game now, Count? What's this fellow want? What's up?”
              His voice was deep and raucous.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              The Count shrugged his shoulders, and it was Holmes who answered.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “If I may put it in a nutshell, Mr. Merton, I should say it was
              all up.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              The boxer still addressed his remarks to his associate.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Is this cove trying to be funny, or what? I'm not in the funny
              mood myself.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “No, I expect not,” said Holmes. “I think I can promise you that
              you will feel even less humorous as the evening advances. Now,
              look here, Count Sylvius. I'm a busy man and I can't waste time.
              I'm going into that bedroom. Pray make yourselves quite at home in
              my absence. You can explain to your friend how the matter lies
              without the restraint of my presence. I shall try over the Hoffman
              ‘Barcarole’ upon my violin. In five minutes I shall return for
              your final answer. You quite grasp the alternative, do you not?
              Shall we take you, or shall we have the stone?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              Holmes withdrew, picking up his violin from the corner as he
              passed. A few moments later the long-drawn, wailing notes of that
              most haunting of tunes came faintly through the closed door of the
              bedroom.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “What is it, then?” asked Merton anxiously as his companion turned
              to him. “Does he know about the stone?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “He knows a damned sight too much about it. I'm not sure that he
              doesn't know all about it.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Good Lord!” The boxer's sallow face turned a shade whiter.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Ikey Sanders has split on us.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “He has, has he? I'll do him down a thick 'un for that if I swing
              for it.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “That won't help us much. We've got to make up our minds what to
              do.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Half a mo',” said the boxer, looking suspiciously at the bedroom
              door. “He's a leary cove that wants watching. I suppose he's not
              listening?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “How can he be listening with that music going?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “That's right. Maybe somebody's behind a curtain. Too many
              curtains in this room.” As he looked round he suddenly saw for the
              first time the effigy in the window, and stood staring and
              pointing, too amazed for words.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Tut! it's only a dummy,” said the Count.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “A fake, is it? Well, strike me! Madame Tussaud ain't in it. It's
              the living spit of him, gown and all. But them curtains, Count!”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Oh, confound the curtains! We are wasting our time, and there is
              none too much. He can lag us over this stone.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“The deuce he can!”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “But he'll let us slip if we only tell him where the swag is.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “What! Give it up? Give up a hundred thousand quid?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“It's one or the other.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>Merton scratched his short-cropped pate.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “He's alone in there. Let's do him in. If his light were out we
              should have nothing to fear.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>The Count shook his head.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “He is armed and ready. If we shot him we could hardly get away in
              a place like this. Besides, it's likely enough that the police
              know whatever evidence he has got. Hallo! What was that?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              There was a vague sound which seemed to come from the window. Both
              men sprang round, but all was quiet. Save for the one strange
              figure seated in the chair, the room was certainly empty.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Something in the street,” said Merton. “Now look here, guv'nor,
              you've got the brains. Surely you can think a way out of it. If
              slugging is no use then it's up to you.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I've fooled better men than he,” the Count answered. “The stone
              is here in my secret pocket. I take no chances leaving it about.
              It can be out of England to-night and cut into four pieces in
              Amsterdam before Sunday. He knows nothing of Van Seddar.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“I thought Van Seddar was going next week.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “He was. But now he must get off by the next boat. One or other of
              us must slip round with the stone to Lime Street and tell him.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“But the false bottom ain't ready.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, he must take it as it is and chance it. There's not a
              moment to lose.” Again, with the sense of danger which becomes an
              instinct with the sportsman, he paused and looked hard at the
              window. Yes, it was surely from the street that the faint sound
              had come.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “As to Holmes,” he continued, “we can fool him easily enough. You
              see, the damned fool won't arrest us if he can get the stone.
              Well, we'll promise him the stone. We'll put him on the wrong
              track about it, and before he finds that it is the wrong track it
              will be in Holland and we out of the country.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “That sounds good to me!” cried Sam Merton with a grin.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “You go on and tell the Dutchman to get a move on him. I'll see
              this sucker and fill him up with a bogus confession. I'll tell him
              that the stone is in Liverpool. Confound that whining music; it
              gets on my nerves! By the time he finds it isn't in Liverpool it
              will be in quarters and we on the blue water. Come back here, out
              of a line with that keyhole. Here is the stone.”
            </TextNode>
            <TextNode>“I wonder you dare carry it.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Where could I have it safer? If we could take it out of Whitehall
              someone else could surely take it out of my lodgings.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Let's have a look at it.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              Count Sylvius cast a somewhat unflattering glance at his associate
              and disregarded the unwashed hand which was extended towards him.

            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, well, no offence, Sam. We can't afford to quarrel. Come
              over to the window if you want to see the beauty properly. Now
              hold it to the light! Here!”

            <TextNode>“Thank you!”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              With a single spring Holmes had leaped from the dummy's chair and
              had grasped the precious jewel. He held it now in one hand, while
              his other pointed a revolver at the Count's head. The two villains
              staggered back in utter amazement. Before they had recovered
              Holmes had pressed the electric bell.
            </TextNode>
            <TextNode>
              “No violence, gentlemen—no violence, I beg of you! Consider the
              furniture! It must be very clear to you that your position is an
              impossible one. The police are waiting below.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              The Count's bewilderment overmastered his rage and fear.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“But how the deuce—?” he gasped.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Your surprise is very natural. You are not aware that a second
              door from my bedroom leads behind that curtain. I fancied that you
              must have heard me when I displaced the figure, but luck was on my
              side. It gave me a chance of listening to your racy conversation
              which would have been painfully constrained had you been aware of
              my presence.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>The Count gave a gesture of resignation.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “We give you best, Holmes. I believe you are the devil himself.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Not far from him, at any rate,” Holmes answered with a polite

            <TextNode>
              Sam Merton's slow intellect had only gradually appreciated the
              situation. Now, as the sound of heavy steps came from the stairs
              outside, he broke silence at last.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “A fair cop!” said he. “But, I say, what about that bloomin'

            <TextNode>
              “Tut, tut!” Holmes answered. “You are perfectly right. Let it

            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              There was an inrush of police, the handcuffs clicked and the
              criminals were led to the waiting cab. Watson lingered with
              Holmes, congratulating him upon this fresh leaf added to his
              laurels. Once more their conversation was interrupted by the
              imperturbable Billy with his card-tray.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Lord Cantlemere, sir.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Show him up, Billy. This is the eminent peer who represents the
              very highest interests,” said Holmes. “He is an excellent and
              loyal person, but rather of the old regime. Shall we make him
              unbend? Dare we venture upon a slight liberty? He knows, we may
              conjecture, nothing of what has occurred.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              The door opened to admit a thin, austere figure with a hatchet
              face and drooping mid-Victorian whiskers of a glossy blackness
              which hardly corresponded with the rounded shoulders and feeble
              gait. Holmes advanced affably, and shook an unresponsive hand.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “How do you do, Lord Cantlemere? It is chilly for the time of

            <TextNode>“No, I thank you; I will not take it off.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>

              “Every man finds his limitations, Mr. Holmes, but at least it

            <TextNode>“No doubt.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Especially upon one point. Possibly you could help me upon it?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “You apply for my advice rather late in the day. I thought that
              you had your own all-sufficient methods. Still, I am ready to help
              you.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “You see, Lord Cantlemere, we can no doubt frame a case against
              the actual thieves.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“When you have caught them.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Exactly. But the question is—how shall we proceed against the
              receiver?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Is this not rather premature?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “It is as well to have our plans ready. Now, what would you regard
              as final evidence against the receiver?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“The actual possession of the stone.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“You would arrest him upon that?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Most undoubtedly.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              Holmes seldom laughed, but he got as near it as his old friend
              Watson could remember.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “In that case, my dear sir, I shall be under the painful necessity
              of advising your arrest.”

              Lord Cantlemere was very angry. Some of the ancient fires
              flickered up into his sallow cheeks.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “You take a great liberty, Mr. Holmes. In fifty years of official
              life I cannot recall such a case. I am a busy man, sir, engaged
              upon important affairs, and I have no time or taste for foolish
              jokes. I may tell you frankly, sir, that I have never been a
              believer in your powers, and that I have always been of the
              opinion that the matter was far safer in the hands of the regular
              police force. Your conduct confirms all my conclusions. I have the
              honour, sir, to wish you good-evening.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              Holmes had swiftly changed his position and was between the peer
              and the door.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “One moment, sir,” said he. “To actually go off with the Mazarin
              stone would be a more serious offence than to be found in
              temporary possession of it.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Sir, this is intolerable! Let me pass.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Put your hand in the right-hand pocket of your overcoat.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“What do you mean, sir?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Come—come, do what I ask.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              An instant later the amazed peer was standing, blinking and
              stammering, with the great yellow stone on his shaking palm.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“What! What! How is this, Mr. Holmes?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Too bad, Lord Cantlemere, too bad!” cried Holmes. “My old friend
              here will tell you that I have an impish habit of practical
              joking. Also that I can never resist a dramatic situation. I took
              the liberty—the very great liberty, I admit—of putting the stone
              into your pocket at the beginning of our interview.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              The old peer stared from the stone to the smiling face before him.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Sir, I am bewildered. But—yes—it is indeed the Mazarin stone. We
              are greatly your debtors, Mr. Holmes. Your sense of humour may, as
              you admit, be somewhat perverted, and its exhibition remarkably
              untimely, but at least I withdraw any reflection I have made upon
              your amazing professional powers. But how—”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “The case is but half finished; the details can wait. No doubt,
              Lord Cantlemere, your pleasure in telling of this successful
              result in the exalted circle to which you return will be some
              small atonement for my practical joke. Billy, you will show his
              Lordship out, and tell Mrs. Hudson that I should be glad if she
              would send up dinner for two as soon as possible.”
