              “We have an inspector who makes a specialty of Saffron Hill and
              the Italian quarter. Well, this dead man had some Catholic emblem
              round his neck, and that, along with his colour, made me think he
              was from the South. Inspector Hill knew him the moment he caught
              sight of him. His name is Pietro Venucci, from Naples, and he is
              one of the greatest cut-throats in London. He is connected with
              the Mafia, which, as you know, is a secret political society,
              enforcing its decrees by murder. Now you see how the affair begins
              to clear up. The other fellow is probably an Italian also, and a
              member of the Mafia. He has broken the rules in some fashion.
              Pietro is set upon his track. Probably the photograph we found in
              his pocket is the man himself, so that he may not knife the wrong
              person. He dogs the fellow, he sees him enter a house, he waits
              outside for him, and in the scuffle he receives his own
              death-wound. How is that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>Holmes clapped his hands approvingly.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Excellent, Lestrade, excellent!” he cried. “But I didn't quite
              follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “The busts! You never can get those busts out of your head. After
              all, that is nothing; petty larceny, six months at the most. It is
              the murder that we are really investigating, and I tell you that I
              am gathering all the threads into my hands.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“And the next stage?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Is a very simple one. I shall go down with Hill to the Italian
              quarter, find the man whose photograph we have got, and arrest him
              on the charge of murder. Will you come with us?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I think not. I fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way. I
              can't say for certain, because it all depends—well, it all depends
              upon a factor which is completely outside our control. But I have
              great hopes—in fact, the betting is exactly two to one—that if you
              will come with us to-night I shall be able to help you to lay him
              by the heels.”

            <TextNode>
              “No; I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to find
              him. If you will come with me to Chiswick to-night, Lestrade, I'll
              promise to go to the Italian quarter with you to-morrow, and no
              harm will be done by the delay. And now I think that a few hours'
              sleep would do us all good, for I do not propose to leave before
              eleven o'clock, and it is unlikely that we shall be back before
              morning. You'll dine with us, Lestrade, and then you are welcome
              to the sofa until it is time for us to start. In the meantime,
              Watson, I should be glad if you would ring for an express
              messenger, for I have a letter to send, and it is important that
              it should go at once.”

              Holmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the old
              daily papers with which one of our lumber-rooms was packed. When
              at last he descended it was with triumph in his eyes, but he said
              nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches. For my
              own part, I had followed step by step the methods by which he had
              traced the various windings of this complex case, and, though I
              could not yet perceive the goal which we would reach, I understood
              clearly that Holmes expected this grotesque criminal to make an
              attempt upon the two remaining busts, one of which, I remembered,
              was at Chiswick. No doubt the object of our journey was to catch
              him in the very act, and I could not but admire the cunning with
              which my friend had inserted a wrong clue in the evening paper, so
              as to give the fellow the idea that he could continue his scheme
              with impunity. I was not surprised when Holmes suggested that I
              should take my revolver with me. He had himself picked up the
              loaded hunting-crop which was his favourite weapon.

              A four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and in it we drove to a
              spot at the other side of Hammersmith Bridge. Here the cabman was
              directed to wait. A short walk brought us to a secluded road
              fringed with pleasant houses, each standing in its own grounds. In
              the light of a street lamp we read “Laburnum Villa” upon the
              gate-post of one of them. The occupants had evidently retired to
              rest, for all was dark save for a fanlight over the hall door,
              which shed a single blurred circle on to the garden path. The
              wooden fence which separated the grounds from the road threw a
              dense black shadow upon the inner side, and here it was that we
              crouched.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I fear that you'll have a long wait,” Holmes whispered. “We may
              thank our stars that it is not raining. I don't think we can even
              venture to smoke to pass the time. However, it's a two to one
              chance that we get something to pay us for our trouble.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              It proved, however, that our vigil was not to be so long as Holmes
              had led us to fear, and it ended in a very sudden and singular
              fashion. In an instant, without the least sound to warn us of his
              coming, the garden gate swung open, and a lithe, dark figure, as
              swift and active as an ape, rushed up the garden path. We saw it
              whisk past the light thrown from over the door and disappear
              against the black shadow of the house. There was a long pause,
              during which we held our breath, and then a very gentle creaking
              sound came to our ears. The window was being opened. The noise
              ceased, and again there was a long silence. The fellow was making
              his way into the house. We saw the sudden flash of a dark lantern
              inside the room. What he sought was evidently not there, for again
              we saw the flash through another blind, and then through another.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Let us get to the open window. We will nab him as he climbs out,”
              Lestrade whispered.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              But before we could move the man had emerged again. As he came out
              into the glimmering patch of light we saw that he carried
              something white under his arm. He looked stealthily all round him.
              The silence of the deserted street reassured him. Turning his back
              upon us he laid down his burden, and the next instant there was
              the sound of a sharp tap, followed by a clatter and rattle. The
              man was so intent upon what he was doing that he never heard our
              steps as we stole across the grass plot. With the bound of a tiger
              Holmes was on his back, and an instant later Lestrade and I had
              him by either wrist and the handcuffs had been fastened. As we
              turned him over I saw a hideous, sallow face, with writhing,
              furious features, glaring up at us, and I knew that it was indeed
              the man of the photograph whom we had secured.

            <TextNode>
              But it was not our prisoner to whom Holmes was giving his
              attention. Squatted on the doorstep, he was engaged in most
              carefully examining that which the man had brought from the house.
              It was a bust of Napoleon like the one which we had seen that
              morning, and it had been broken into similar fragments. Carefully
              Holmes held each separate shard to the light, but in no way did it
              differ from any other shattered piece of plaster. He had just
              completed his examination when the hall lights flew up, the door
              opened, and the owner of the house, a jovial, rotund figure in
              shirt and trousers, presented himself.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Mr. Josiah Brown, I suppose?” said Holmes.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Yes, sir; and you, no doubt, are Mr. Sherlock Holmes? I had the
              note which you sent by the express messenger, and I did exactly
              what you told me. We locked every door on the inside and awaited
              developments. Well, I'm very glad to see that you have got the
              rascal. I hope, gentlemen, that you will come in and have some
              refreshment.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              However, Lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe quarters,
              so within a few minutes our cab had been summoned and we were all
              four upon our way to London. Not a word would our captive say; but
              he glared at us from the shadow of his matted hair, and once, when
              my hand seemed within his reach, he snapped at it like a hungry
              wolf. We stayed long enough at the police-station to learn that a
              search of his clothing revealed nothing save a few shillings and a
              long sheath knife, the handle of which bore copious traces of
              recent blood.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “That's all right,” said Lestrade, as we parted. “Hill knows all
              these gentry, and he will give a name to him. You'll find that my
              theory of the Mafia will work out all right. But I'm sure I am
              exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Holmes, for the workmanlike way in
              which you laid hands upon him. I don't quite understand it all
              yet.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations,” said
              Holmes. “Besides, there are one or two details which are not
              finished off, and it is one of those cases which are worth working
              out to the very end. If you will come round once more to my rooms
              at six o'clock to-morrow I think I shall be able to show you that
              even now you have not grasped the entire meaning of this business,
              which presents some features which make it absolutely original in
              the history of crime. If ever I permit you to chronicle any more
              of my little problems, Watson, I foresee that you will enliven
              your pages by an account of the singular adventure of the
              Napoleonic busts.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              When we met again next evening Lestrade was furnished with much
              information concerning our prisoner. His name, it appeared, was
              Beppo, second name unknown. He was a well-known ne'er-do-well
              among the Italian colony. He had once been a skilful sculptor and
              had earned an honest living, but he had taken to evil courses and
              had twice already been in jail—once for a petty theft and once, as
              we had already heard, for stabbing a fellow-countryman. He could
              talk English perfectly well. His reasons for destroying the busts
              were still unknown, and he refused to answer any questions upon
              the subject; but the police had discovered that these same busts
              might very well have been made by his own hands, since he was
              engaged in this class of work at the establishment of Gelder & Co.
              To all this information, much of which we already knew, Holmes
              listened with polite attention; but I, who knew him so well, could
              clearly see that his thoughts were elsewhere, and I detected a
              mixture of mingled uneasiness and expectation beneath that mask
              which he was wont to assume. At last he started in his chair and
              his eyes brightened. There had been a ring at the bell. A minute
              later we heard steps upon the stairs, and an elderly, red-faced
              man with grizzled side-whiskers was ushered in. In his right hand
              he carried an old-fashioned carpet-bag, which he placed upon the
              table.

            <TextNode>
              My friend bowed and smiled. “Mr. Sandeford, of Reading, I

            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Yes, sir, I fear that I am a little late; but the trains were

            <TextNode>
              “Of course you must have been surprised, but the explanation is

              fifteen shillings for the bust, and I think you ought to know that
              before I take ten pounds from you.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I am sure the scruple does you honour, Mr. Sandeford. But I have

            <TextNode>
              “Well, it is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes. I brought the bust
              up with me, as you asked me to do. Here it is!” He opened his bag,
              and at last we saw placed upon our table a complete specimen of
              that bust which we had already seen more than once in fragments.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              Holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a ten-pound note upon

            <TextNode>
              “You will kindly sign that paper, Mr. Sandeford, in the presence
              of these witnesses. It is simply to say that you transfer every
              possible right that you ever had in the bust to me. I am a
              methodical man, you see, and you never know what turn events might
              take afterwards. Thank you, Mr. Sandeford; here is your money, and
              I wish you a very good evening.”

            <TextNode>
              When our visitor had disappeared Sherlock Holmes's movements were
              such as to rivet our attention. He began by taking a clean white
              cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table. Then he placed
              his newly-acquired bust in the centre of the cloth. Finally, he
              picked up his hunting-crop and struck Napoleon a sharp blow on the
              top of the head. The figure broke into fragments, and Holmes bent
              eagerly over the shattered remains. Next instant, with a loud
              shout of triumph, he held up one splinter, in which a round, dark
              object was fixed like a plum in a pudding.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Gentlemen,” he cried, “let me introduce you to the famous black

            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              Lestrade and I sat silent for a moment, and then, with a
              spontaneous impulse, we both broke out clapping as at the
              well-wrought crisis of a play. A flush of colour sprang to
              Holmes's pale cheeks, and he bowed to us like the master dramatist
              who receives the homage of his audience. It was at such moments
              that for an instant he ceased to be a reasoning machine, and
              betrayed his human love for admiration and applause. The same
              singularly proud and reserved nature which turned away with
              disdain from popular notoriety was capable of being moved to its
              depths by spontaneous wonder and praise from a friend.

              “Yes, gentlemen,” said he, “it is the most famous pearl now
              existing in the world, and it has been my good fortune, by a
              connected chain of inductive reasoning, to trace it from the
              Prince of Colonna's bedroom at the Dacre Hotel, where it was lost,
              to the interior of this, the last of the six busts of Napoleon
              which were manufactured by Gelder & Co., of Stepney. You will
              remember, Lestrade, the sensation caused by the disappearance of
              this valuable jewel, and the vain efforts of the London police to
              recover it. I was myself consulted upon the case; but I was unable
              to throw any light upon it. Suspicion fell upon the maid of the
              Princess, who was an Italian, and it was proved that she had a
              brother in London, but we failed to trace any connection between
              them. The maid's name was Lucretia Venucci, and there is no doubt
              in my mind that this Pietro who was murdered two nights ago was
              the brother. I have been looking up the dates in the old files of
              the paper, and I find that the disappearance of the pearl was
              exactly two days before the arrest of Beppo for some crime of
              violence, an event which took place in the factory of Gelder &
              Co., at the very moment when these busts were being made. Now you
              clearly see the sequence of events, though you see them, of
              course, in the inverse order to the way in which they presented
              themselves to me. Beppo had the pearl in his possession. He may
              have stolen it from Pietro, he may have been Pietro's confederate,
              he may have been the go-between of Pietro and his sister. It is of
              no consequence to us which is the correct solution.

              “The main fact is that he had the pearl, and at that moment, when
              it was on his person, he was pursued by the police. He made for
              the factory in which he worked, and he knew that he had only a few
              minutes in which to conceal this enormously valuable prize, which
              would otherwise be found on him when he was searched. Six plaster
              casts of Napoleon were drying in the passage. One of them was
              still soft. In an instant Beppo, a skilful workman, made a small
              hole in the wet plaster, dropped in the pearl, and with a few
              touches covered over the aperture once more. It was an admirable
              hiding-place. No one could possibly find it. But Beppo was
              condemned to a year's imprisonment, and in the meanwhile his six
              busts were scattered over London. He could not tell which
              contained his treasure. Only by breaking them could he see. Even
              shaking would tell him nothing, for as the plaster was wet it was
              probable that the pearl would adhere to it—as, in fact, it has
              done. Beppo did not despair, and he conducted his search with
              considerable ingenuity and perseverance. Through a cousin who
              works with Gelder he found out the retail firms who had bought the
              busts. He managed to find employment with Morse Hudson, and in
              that way tracked down three of them. The pearl was not there.
              Then, with the help of some Italian employe, he succeeded in
              finding out where the other three busts had gone. The first was at
              Harker's. There he was dogged by his confederate, who held Beppo
              responsible for the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed him in the
              scuffle which followed.”

              “If he was his confederate why should he carry his photograph?” I
              asked.

              “As a means of tracing him if he wished to inquire about him from
              any third person. That was the obvious reason. Well, after the
              murder I calculated that Beppo would probably hurry rather than
              delay his movements. He would fear that the police would read his
              secret, and so he hastened on before they should get ahead of him.
              Of course, I could not say that he had not found the pearl in
              Harker's bust. I had not even concluded for certain that it was
              the pearl; but it was evident to me that he was looking for
              something, since he carried the bust past the other houses in
              order to break it in the garden which had a lamp overlooking it.
              Since Harker's bust was one in three the chances were exactly as I
              told you, two to one against the pearl being inside it. There
              remained two busts, and it was obvious that he would go for the
              London one first. I warned the inmates of the house, so as to
              avoid a second tragedy, and we went down with the happiest
              results. By that time, of course, I knew for certain that it was
              the Borgia pearl that we were after. The name of the murdered man
              linked the one event with the other. There only remained a single
              bust—the Reading one—and the pearl must be there. I bought it in
              your presence from the owner—and there it lies.”

              “Well,” said Lestrade, “I've seen you handle a good many cases,
              Mr. Holmes, but I don't know that I ever knew a more workmanlike
              one than that. We're not jealous of you at Scotland Yard. No, sir,
              we are very proud of you, and if you come down to-morrow there's
              not a man, from the oldest inspector to the youngest constable,
              who wouldn't be glad to shake you by the hand.”

              “Thank you!” said Holmes. “Thank you!” and as he turned away it
              seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the softer human
              emotions than I had ever seen him. A moment later he was the cold
              and practical thinker once more. “Put the pearl in the safe,
              Watson,” said he, “and get out the papers of the Conk-Singleton
              forgery case. Good-bye, Lestrade. If any little problem comes your
              way I shall be happy, if I can, to give you a hint or two as to
              its solution.”
