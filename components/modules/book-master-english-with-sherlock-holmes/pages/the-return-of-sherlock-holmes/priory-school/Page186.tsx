              “By Heaven, Watson, I believe that I've got it!” he cried. “Yes,
              yes, it must be so. Watson, do you remember seeing any cow-tracks
              to-day?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Yes, several.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Where?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Well, everywhere. They were at the morass, and again on the path,
              and again near where poor Heidegger met his death.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Exactly. Well, now, Watson, how many cows did you see on the
              moor?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“I don't remember seeing any.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Strange, Watson, that we should see tracks all along our line,
              but never a cow on the whole moor; very strange, Watson, eh?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Yes, it is strange.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Now, Watson, make an effort; throw your mind back! Can you see
              those tracks upon the path?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Yes, I can.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Can you recall that the tracks were sometimes like that,
              Watson”—he arranged a number of bread-crumbs in this fashion—: : :
              : :—“and sometimes like this”—: ˙ : ˙ : ˙ : ˙—“and occasionally
              like this”—. ˙ . ˙ . ˙ . “Can you remember that?”

            <TextNode>“No, I cannot.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “But I can. I could swear to it. However, we will go back at our
              leisure and verify it. What a blind beetle I have been not to draw
              my conclusion!”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“And what is your conclusion?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Only that it is a remarkable cow which walks, canters, and
              gallops. By George, Watson, it was no brain of a country publican
              that thought out such a blind as that! The coast seems to be
              clear, save for that lad in the smithy. Let us slip out and see
              what we can see.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              There were two rough-haired, unkempt horses in the tumble-down
              stable. Holmes raised the hind leg of one of them and laughed
              aloud.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Old shoes, but newly shod—old shoes, but new nails. This case
              deserves to be a classic. Let us go across to the smithy.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              The lad continued his work without regarding us. I saw Holmes's
              eye darting to right and left among the litter of iron and wood
              which was scattered about the floor. Suddenly, however, we heard a
              step behind us, and there was the landlord, his heavy eyebrows
              drawn over his savage eyes, his swarthy features convulsed with
              passion. He held a short, metal-headed stick in his hand, and he
              advanced in so menacing a fashion that I was right glad to feel
              the revolver in my pocket.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “You infernal spies!” the man cried. “What are you doing there?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Why, Mr. Reuben Hayes,” said Holmes, coolly, “one might think
              that you were afraid of our finding something out.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              The man mastered himself with a violent effort, and his grim mouth
              loosened into a false laugh, which was more menacing than his
              frown.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “You're welcome to all you can find out in my smithy,” said he.
              “But look here, mister, I don't care for folk poking about my
              place without my leave, so the sooner you pay your score and get
              out of this the better I shall be pleased.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “All right, Mr. Hayes—no harm meant,” said Holmes. “We have been
              having a look at your horses, but I think I'll walk after all.
              It's not far, I believe.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Not more than two miles to the Hall gates. That's the road to the
              left.” He watched us with sullen eyes until we had left his
              premises.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              We did not go very far along the road, for Holmes stopped the
              instant that the curve hid us from the landlord's view.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “We were warm, as the children say, at that inn,” said he. “I seem
              to grow colder every step that I take away from it. No, no; I
              can't possibly leave it.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I am convinced,” said I, “that this Reuben Hayes knows all about
              it. A more self-evident villain I never saw.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Oh! he impressed you in that way, did he? There are the horses,
              there is the smithy. Yes, it is an interesting place, this
              Fighting Cock. I think we shall have another look at it in an
              unobtrusive way.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              A long, sloping hillside, dotted with grey limestone boulders,
              stretched behind us. We had turned off the road, and were making
              our way up the hill, when, looking in the direction of Holdernesse
              Hall, I saw a cyclist coming swiftly along.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Get down, Watson!” cried Holmes, with a heavy hand upon my
              shoulder. We had hardly sunk from view when the man flew past us
              on the road. Amid a rolling cloud of dust I caught a glimpse of a
              pale, agitated face—a face with horror in every lineament, the
              mouth open, the eyes staring wildly in front. It was like some
              strange caricature of the dapper James Wilder whom we had seen the
              night before.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “The Duke's secretary!” cried Holmes. “Come, Watson, let us see
              what he does.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              We scrambled from rock to rock until in a few moments we had made
              our way to a point from which we could see the front door of the
              inn. Wilder's bicycle was leaning against the wall beside it. No
              one was moving about the house, nor could we catch a glimpse of
              any faces at the windows. Slowly the twilight crept down as the
              sun sank behind the high towers of Holdernesse Hall. Then in the
              gloom we saw the two side-lamps of a trap light up in the stable
              yard of the inn, and shortly afterwards heard the rattle of hoofs,
              as it wheeled out into the road and tore off at a furious pace in
              the direction of Chesterfield.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “What do you make of that, Watson?” Holmes whispered.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“It looks like a flight.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “A single man in a dog-cart, so far as I could see. Well, it
              certainly was not Mr. James Wilder, for there he is at the door.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              A red square of light had sprung out of the darkness. In the
              middle of it was the black figure of the secretary, his head
              advanced, peering out into the night. It was evident that he was
              expecting someone. Then at last there were steps in the road, a
              second figure was visible for an instant against the light, the
              door shut, and all was black once more. Five minutes later a lamp
              was lit in a room upon the first floor.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “It seems to be a curious class of custom that is done by the
              Fighting Cock,” said Holmes.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“The bar is on the other side.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Quite so. These are what one may call the private guests. Now,
              what in the world is Mr. James Wilder doing in that den at this
              hour of night, and who is the companion who comes to meet him
              there? Come, Watson, we must really take a risk and try to
              investigate this a little more closely.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              Together we stole down to the road and crept across to the door of
              the inn. The bicycle still leaned against the wall. Holmes struck
              a match and held it to the back wheel, and I heard him chuckle as
              the light fell upon a patched Dunlop tyre. Up above us was the
              lighted window.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I must have a peep through that, Watson. If you bend your back
              and support yourself upon the wall, I think that I can manage.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              An instant later his feet were on my shoulders. But he was hardly
              up before he was down again.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Come, my friend,” said he, “our day's work has been quite long
              enough. I think that we have gathered all that we can. It's a long
              walk to the school, and the sooner we get started the better.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              He hardly opened his lips during that weary trudge across the
              moor, nor would he enter the school when he reached it, but went
              on to Mackleton Station, whence he could send some telegrams. Late
              at night I heard him consoling Dr. Huxtable, prostrated by the
              tragedy of his master's death, and later still he entered my room
              as alert and vigorous as he had been when he started in the
              morning. “All goes well, my friend,” said he. “I promise that
              before to-morrow evening we shall have reached the solution of the
              mystery.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              At eleven o'clock next morning my friend and I were walking up the
              famous yew avenue of Holdernesse Hall. We were ushered through the
              magnificent Elizabethan doorway and into his Grace's study. There
              we found Mr. James Wilder, demure and courtly, but with some trace
              of that wild terror of the night before still lurking in his
              furtive eyes and in his twitching features.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “You have come to see his Grace? I am sorry; but the fact is that
              the Duke is far from well. He has been very much upset by the
              tragic news. We received a telegram from Dr. Huxtable yesterday
              afternoon, which told us of your discovery.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“I must see the Duke, Mr. Wilder.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“But he is in his room.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Then I must go to his room.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“I believe he is in his bed.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“I will see him there.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              Holmes's cold and inexorable manner showed the secretary that it
              was useless to argue with him.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Very good, Mr. Holmes; I will tell him that you are here.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              After half an hour's delay the great nobleman appeared. His face
              was more cadaverous than ever, his shoulders had rounded, and he
              seemed to me to be an altogether older man than he had been the
              morning before. He greeted us with a stately courtesy and seated
              himself at his desk, his red beard streaming down on to the table.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Well, Mr. Holmes?” said he.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              But my friend's eyes were fixed upon the secretary, who stood by
              his master's chair.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I think, your Grace, that I could speak more freely in Mr.
              Wilder's absence.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              The man turned a shade paler and cast a malignant glance at
              Holmes.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“If your Grace wishes—”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Yes, yes; you had better go. Now, Mr. Holmes, what have you to
              say?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              My friend waited until the door had closed behind the retreating
              secretary.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “The fact is, your Grace,” said he, “that my colleague, Dr.
              Watson, and myself had an assurance from Dr. Huxtable that a
              reward had been offered in this case. I should like to have this
              confirmed from your own lips.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Certainly, Mr. Holmes.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “It amounted, if I am correctly informed, to five thousand pounds
              to anyone who will tell you where your son is?”

            <TextNode>“Exactly.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “And another thousand to the man who will name the person or
              persons who keep him in custody?”

            <TextNode>“Exactly.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Under the latter heading is included, no doubt, not only those
              who may have taken him away, but also those who conspire to keep
              him in his present position?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Yes, yes,” cried the Duke, impatiently. “If you do your work
              well, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, you will have no reason to complain of
              niggardly treatment.”

              My friend rubbed his thin hands together with an appearance of

            <TextNode>
              “I fancy that I see your Grace's cheque-book upon the table,” said
              he. “I should be glad if you would make me out a cheque for six
              thousand pounds. It would be as well, perhaps, for you to cross

              Never shall I forget the Duke's appearance as he sprang up and
              clawed with his hands like one who is sinking into an abyss. Then,
              with an extraordinary effort of aristocratic self-command, he sat
              down and sank his face in his hands. It was some minutes before he
              spoke.

              “How much do you know?” he asked at last, without raising his

            <TextNode>“I saw you together last night.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Does anyone else besides your friend know?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“I have spoken to no one.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              The Duke took a pen in his quivering fingers and opened his
              cheque-book.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I shall be as good as my word, Mr. Holmes. I am about to write
              your cheque, however unwelcome the information which you have
              gained may be to me. When the offer was first made I little
              thought the turn which events might take. But you and your friend
              are men of discretion, Mr. Holmes?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“I hardly understand your Grace.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I must put it plainly, Mr. Holmes. If only you two know of this
              incident, there is no reason why it should go any farther. I think
              twelve thousand pounds is the sum that I owe you, is it not?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>But Holmes smiled and shook his head.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I fear, your Grace, that matters can hardly be arranged so
              easily. There is the death of this schoolmaster to be accounted
              for.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “But James knew nothing of that. You cannot hold him responsible
              for that. It was the work of this brutal ruffian whom he had the
              misfortune to employ.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I must take the view, your Grace, that when a man embarks upon a
              crime he is morally guilty of any other crime which may spring
              from it.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Morally, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right. But surely not in
              the eyes of the law. A man cannot be condemned for a murder at
              which he was not present, and which he loathes and abhors as much
              as you do. The instant that he heard of it he made a complete
              confession to me, so filled was he with horror and remorse. He
              lost not an hour in breaking entirely with the murderer. Oh, Mr.
              Holmes, you must save him—you must save him! I tell you that you
              must save him!” The Duke had dropped the last attempt at
              self-command, and was pacing the room with a convulsed face and
              with his clenched hands raving in the air. At last he mastered
              himself and sat down once more at his desk. “I appreciate your
              conduct in coming here before you spoke to anyone else,” said he.
              “At least, we may take counsel how far we can minimize this
              hideous scandal.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Exactly,” said Holmes. “I think, your Grace, that this can only
              be done by absolute and complete frankness between us. I am
              disposed to help your Grace to the best of my ability; but in
              order to do so I must understand to the last detail how the matter
              stands. I realize that your words applied to Mr. James Wilder, and
              that he is not the murderer.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“No; the murderer has escaped.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>Sherlock Holmes smiled demurely.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Your Grace can hardly have heard of any small reputation which I
              possess, or you would not imagine that it is so easy to escape me.
              Mr. Reuben Hayes was arrested at Chesterfield on my information at
              eleven o'clock last night. I had a telegram from the head of the

            <TextNode>
              The Duke leaned back in his chair and stared with amazement at my
              friend.

            <TextNode>
              “You seem to have powers that are hardly human,” said he. “So
              Reuben Hayes is taken? I am right glad to hear it, if it will not
              react upon the fate of James.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Your secretary?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“No, sir; my son.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>It was Holmes's turn to look astonished.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I confess that this is entirely new to me, your Grace. I must beg
              you to be more explicit.”

            <TextNode>
              “I will conceal nothing from you. I agree with you that complete
              frankness, however painful it may be to me, is the best policy in
              this desperate situation to which James's folly and jealousy have
              reduced us. When I was a very young man, Mr. Holmes, I loved with
              such a love as comes only once in a lifetime. I offered the lady
              marriage, but she refused it on the grounds that such a match
              might mar my career. Had she lived I would certainly never have
              married anyone else. She died, and left this one child, whom for
              her sake I have cherished and cared for. I could not acknowledge
              the paternity to the world; but I gave him the best of educations,
              and since he came to manhood I have kept him near my person. He
              surprised my secret, and has presumed ever since upon the claim
              which he has upon me and upon his power of provoking a scandal,
              which would be abhorrent to me. His presence had something to do
              with the unhappy issue of my marriage. Above all, he hated my
              young legitimate heir from the first with a persistent hatred. You
              may well ask me why, under these circumstances, I still kept James
              under my roof. I answer that it was because I could see his
              mother's face in his, and that for her dear sake there was no end
              to my long-suffering. All her pretty ways, too—there was not one
              of them which he could not suggest and bring back to my memory. I
              could not send him away. But I feared so much lest he should do
              Arthur—that is, Lord Saltire—a mischief that I dispatched him for
              safety to Dr. Huxtable's school.

            <TextNode>
              “James came into contact with this fellow Hayes because the man
              was a tenant of mine, and James acted as agent. The fellow was a
              rascal from the beginning; but in some extraordinary way James
              became intimate with him. He had always a taste for low company.
              When James determined to kidnap Lord Saltire it was of this man's
              service that he availed himself. You remember that I wrote to
              Arthur upon that last day. Well, James opened the letter and
              inserted a note asking Arthur to meet him in a little wood called
              the Ragged Shaw, which is near to the school. He used the
              Duchess's name, and in that way got the boy to come. That evening
              James bicycled over—I am telling you what he has himself confessed
              to me—and he told Arthur, whom he met in the wood, that his mother
              longed to see him, that she was awaiting him on the moor, and that
              if he would come back into the wood at midnight he would find a
              man with a horse, who would take him to her. Poor Arthur fell into
              the trap. He came to the appointment and found this fellow Hayes
              with a led pony. Arthur mounted, and they set off together. It
              appears—though this James only heard yesterday—that they were
              pursued, that Hayes struck the pursuer with his stick, and that
              the man died of his injuries. Hayes brought Arthur to his
              public-house, the Fighting Cock, where he was confined in an upper
              room, under the care of Mrs. Hayes, who is a kindly woman, but
              entirely under the control of her brutal husband.

              “Well, Mr. Holmes, that was the state of affairs when I first saw
              you two days ago. I had no more idea of the truth than you. You
              will ask me what was James's motive in doing such a deed. I answer
              that there was a great deal which was unreasoning and fanatical in
              the hatred which he bore my heir. In his view he should himself
              have been heir of all my estates, and he deeply resented those
              social laws which made it impossible. At the same time he had a
              definite motive also. He was eager that I should break the entail,
              and he was of opinion that it lay in my power to do so. He
              intended to make a bargain with me—to restore Arthur if I would
              break the entail, and so make it possible for the estate to be
              left to him by will. He knew well that I should never willingly
              invoke the aid of the police against him. I say that he would have
              proposed such a bargain to me, but he did not actually do so, for
              events moved too quickly for him, and he had not time to put his
              plans into practice.

              “What brought all his wicked scheme to wreck was your discovery of
              this man Heidegger's dead body. James was seized with horror at
              the news. It came to us yesterday as we sat together in this
              study. Dr. Huxtable had sent a telegram. James was so overwhelmed
              with grief and agitation that my suspicions, which had never been
              entirely absent, rose instantly to a certainty, and I taxed him
              with the deed. He made a complete voluntary confession. Then he
              implored me to keep his secret for three days longer, so as to
              give his wretched accomplice a chance of saving his guilty life. I
              yielded—as I have always yielded—to his prayers, and instantly
              James hurried off to the Fighting Cock to warn Hayes and give him
              the means of flight. I could not go there by daylight without
              provoking comment, but as soon as night fell I hurried off to see
              my dear Arthur. I found him safe and well, but horrified beyond
              expression by the dreadful deed he had witnessed. In deference to
              my promise, and much against my will, I consented to leave him
              there for three days under the charge of Mrs. Hayes, since it was
              evident that it was impossible to inform the police where he was
              without telling them also who was the murderer, and I could not
              see how that murderer could be punished without ruin to my
              unfortunate James. You asked for frankness, Mr. Holmes, and I have
              taken you at your word, for I have now told you everything without
              an attempt at circumlocution or concealment. Do you in turn be as
              frank with me.”

              “I will,” said Holmes. “In the first place, your Grace, I am bound

              position in the eyes of the law. You have condoned a felony and
              you have aided the escape of a murderer; for I cannot doubt that
              any money which was taken by James Wilder to aid his accomplice in
              his flight came from your Grace's purse.”
