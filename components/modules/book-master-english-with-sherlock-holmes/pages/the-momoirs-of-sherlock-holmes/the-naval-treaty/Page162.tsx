              A shadow passed over the expressive face of the statesman. “Very
              grave results indeed.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“And have they occurred?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Not yet.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “If the treaty had reached, let us say, the French or Russian
              Foreign Office, you would expect to hear of it?”

            <TextNode>
              “I should,” said Lord Holdhurst, with a wry face.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Since nearly ten weeks have elapsed, then, and nothing has been
              heard, it is not unfair to suppose that for some reason the treaty
              has not reached them.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>Lord Holdhurst shrugged his shoulders.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “We can hardly suppose, Mr. Holmes, that the thief took the treaty
              in order to frame it and hang it up.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Perhaps he is waiting for a better price.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “If he waits a little longer he will get no price at all. The
              treaty will cease to be secret in a few months.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “That is most important,” said Holmes. “Of course, it is a
              possible supposition that the thief has had a sudden illness—”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “An attack of brain-fever, for example?” asked the statesman,
              flashing a swift glance at him.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I did not say so,” said Holmes, imperturbably. “And now, Lord
              Holdhurst, we have already taken up too much of your valuable
              time, and we shall wish you good-day.”

              “Every success to your investigation, be the criminal who it may,”
              answered the nobleman, as he bowed us out the door.

              “He's a fine fellow,” said Holmes, as we came out into Whitehall.
              “But he has a struggle to keep up his position. He is far from
              rich and has many calls. You noticed, of course, that his boots
              had been re-soled? Now, Watson, I won't detain you from your
              legitimate work any longer. I shall do nothing more to-day, unless
              I have an answer to my cab advertisement. But I should be
              extremely obliged to you if you would come down with me to Woking
              to-morrow, by the same train which we took yesterday.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              I met him accordingly next morning and we traveled down to Woking
              together. He had had no answer to his advertisement, he said, and
              no fresh light had been thrown upon the case. He had, when he so
              willed it, the utter immobility of countenance of a red Indian,
              and I could not gather from his appearance whether he was
              satisfied or not with the position of the case. His conversation,
              I remember, was about the Bertillon system of measurements, and he
              expressed his enthusiastic admiration of the French savant.

              We found our client still under the charge of his devoted nurse,
              but looking considerably better than before. He rose from the sofa
              and greeted us without difficulty when we entered.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Any news?” he asked, eagerly.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “My report, as I expected, is a negative one,” said Holmes. “I
              have seen Forbes, and I have seen your uncle, and I have set one
              or two trains of inquiry upon foot which may lead to something.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“You have not lost heart, then?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“By no means.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “God bless you for saying that!” cried Miss Harrison. “If we keep
              our courage and our patience the truth must come out.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “We have more to tell you than you have for us,” said Phelps,
              reseating himself upon the couch.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“I hoped you might have something.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Yes, we have had an adventure during the night, and one which
              might have proved to be a serious one.” His expression grew very
              grave as he spoke, and a look of something akin to fear sprang up
              in his eyes. “Do you know,” said he, “that I begin to believe that
              I am the unconscious centre of some monstrous conspiracy, and that
              my life is aimed at as well as my honor?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Ah!” cried Holmes.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “It sounds incredible, for I have not, as far as I know, an enemy
              in the world. Yet from last night's experience I can come to no
              other conclusion.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Pray let me hear it.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “You must know that last night was the very first night that I
              have ever slept without a nurse in the room. I was so much better
              that I thought I could dispense with one. I had a night-light
              burning, however. Well, about two in the morning I had sunk into a
              light sleep when I was suddenly aroused by a slight noise. It was
              like the sound which a mouse makes when it is gnawing a plank, and
              I lay listening to it for some time under the impression that it
              must come from that cause. Then it grew louder, and suddenly there
              came from the window a sharp metallic snick. I sat up in
              amazement. There could be no doubt what the sounds were now. The
              first ones had been caused by some one forcing an instrument
              through the slit between the sashes, and the second by the catch
              being pressed back.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “There was a pause then for about ten minutes, as if the person
              were waiting to see whether the noise had awakened me. Then I
              heard a gentle creaking as the window was very slowly opened. I
              could stand it no longer, for my nerves are not what they used to
              be. I sprang out of bed and flung open the shutters. A man was
              crouching at the window. I could see little of him, for he was
              gone like a flash. He was wrapped in some sort of cloak which came
              across the lower part of his face. One thing only I am sure of,
              and that is that he had some weapon in his hand. It looked to me
              like a long knife. I distinctly saw the gleam of it as he turned
              to run.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “This is most interesting,” said Holmes. “Pray what did you do
              then?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I should have followed him through the open window if I had been
              stronger. As it was, I rang the bell and roused the house. It took
              me some little time, for the bell rings in the kitchen and the
              servants all sleep upstairs. I shouted, however, and that brought
              Joseph down, and he roused the others. Joseph and the groom found
              marks on the bed outside the window, but the weather has been so
              dry lately that they found it hopeless to follow the trail across
              the grass. There's a place, however, on the wooden fence which
              skirts the road which shows signs, they tell me, as if some one
              had got over, and had snapped the top of the rail in doing so. I
              have said nothing to the local police yet, for I thought I had
              best have your opinion first.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              This tale of our client's appeared to have an extraordinary effect
              upon Sherlock Holmes. He rose from his chair and paced about the
              room in uncontrollable excitement.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Misfortunes never come single,” said Phelps, smiling, though it
              was evident that his adventure had somewhat shaken him.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “You have certainly had your share,” said Holmes. “Do you think
              you could walk round the house with me?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Oh, yes, I should like a little sunshine. Joseph will come, too.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“And I also,” said Miss Harrison.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I am afraid not,” said Holmes, shaking his head. “I think I must
              ask you to remain sitting exactly where you are.”

            <TextNode>
              The young lady resumed her seat with an air of displeasure. Her
              brother, however, had joined us and we set off all four together.
              We passed round the lawn to the outside of the young diplomatist's
              window. There were, as he had said, marks upon the bed, but they
              were hopelessly blurred and vague. Holmes stopped over them for an
              instant, and then rose shrugging his shoulders.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “I don't think any one could make much of this,” said he. “Let us
              go round the house and see why this particular room was chose by
              the burglar. I should have thought those larger windows of the
              drawing-room and dining-room would have had more attractions for
              him.”

            <TextNode>
              “They are more visible from the road,” suggested Mr. Joseph
              Harrison.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Ah, yes, of course. There is a door here which he might have
              attempted. What is it for?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “It is the side entrance for trades-people. Of course it is locked
              at night.”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Have you ever had an alarm like this before?”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Never,” said our client.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “Do you keep plate in the house, or anything to attract burglars?”
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>“Nothing of value.”</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              Holmes strolled round the house with his hands in his pockets and
              a negligent air which was unusual with him.
            </TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “By the way,” said he to Joseph Harrison, “you found some place, I
              understand, where the fellow scaled the fence. Let us have a look
              at that!”
            </TextNode>

              The plump young man led us to a spot where the top of one of the
              wooden rails had been cracked. A small fragment of the wood was
              hanging down. Holmes pulled it off and examined it critically.

            <TextNode>“Well, possibly so.”</TextNode>
            <TextNode>
              “There are no marks of any one jumping down upon the other side.
              No, I fancy we shall get no help here. Let us go back to the
              bedroom and talk the matter over.”

              Percy Phelps was walking very slowly, leaning upon the arm of his
              future brother-in-law. Holmes walked swiftly across the lawn, and
              we were at the open window of the bedroom long before the others
              came up.

            <TextNode>
              “Miss Harrison,” said Holmes, speaking with the utmost intensity
              of manner, “you must stay where you are all day. Let nothing
              prevent you from staying where you are all day. It is of the
              utmost importance.”
            </TextNode>
            <TextNode>
              “Certainly, if you wish it, Mr. Holmes,” said the girl in

            <TextNode>
              “When you go to bed lock the door of this room on the outside and

              “Why do you sit moping there, Annie?” cried her brother. “Come out

              “No, thank you, Joseph. I have a slight headache and this room is

            <TextNode>
              “Well, in investigating this minor affair we must not lose sight
              of our main inquiry. It would be a very great help to me if you
              would come up to London with us.”

            <TextNode>“At once?”</TextNode>
            <TextNode>
              “Well, as soon as you conveniently can. Say in an hour.”
            </TextNode>
            <TextNode>
              “I feel quite strong enough, if I can really be of any help.”
            </TextNode>
            <TextNode>“The greatest possible.”</TextNode>
            <TextNode>
              “Perhaps you would like me to stay there to-night?”

            <TextNode>“I was just going to propose it.”</TextNode>
            <TextNode>
              “Then, if my friend of the night comes to revisit me, he will find
              the bird flown. We are all in your hands, Mr. Holmes, and you must
              tell us exactly what you would like done. Perhaps you would prefer
              that Joseph came with us so as to look after me?”
            </TextNode>
            <TextNode>
              “Oh, no; my friend Watson is a medical man, you know, and he'll
              look after you. We'll have our lunch here, if you will permit us,
              and then we shall all three set off for town together.”

            <TextNode>
              It was arranged as he suggested, though Miss Harrison excused
              herself from leaving the bedroom, in accordance with Holmes's
              suggestion. What the object of my friend's manoeuvres was I could
              not conceive, unless it were to keep the lady away from Phelps,
              who, rejoiced by his returning health and by the prospect of
              action, lunched with us in the dining-room. Holmes had still more
              startling surprise for us, however, for, after accompanying us
              down to the station and seeing us into our carriage, he calmly
              announced that he had no intention of leaving Woking.

            <TextNode>
              “There are one or two small points which I should desire to clear
              up before I go,” said he. “Your absence, Mr. Phelps, will in some
              ways rather assist me. Watson, when you reach London you would
              oblige me by driving at once to Baker Street with our friend here,
              and remaining with him until I see you again. It is fortunate that
              you are old school-fellows, as you must have much to talk over.
              Mr. Phelps can have the spare bedroom to-night, and I will be with
              you in time for breakfast, for there is a train which will take me
              into Waterloo at eight.”
            </TextNode>
            <TextNode>
              “But how about our investigation in London?” asked Phelps,

            <TextNode>
              “We can do that to-morrow. I think that just at present I can be

            <TextNode>
              “You might tell them at Briarbrae that I hope to be back to-morrow
              night,” cried Phelps, as we began to move from the platform.
            </TextNode>

              “I hardly expect to go back to Briarbrae,” answered Holmes, and
              waved his hand to us cheerily as we shot out from the station.

              Phelps and I talked it over on our journey, but neither of us
              could devise a satisfactory reason for this new development.

              “I suppose he wants to find out some clue as to the burglary last
              night, if a burglar it was. For myself, I don't believe it was an
              ordinary thief.”

              “Upon my word, you may put it down to my weak nerves or not, but I
              believe there is some deep political intrigue going on around me,
              and that for some reason that passes my understanding my life is
              aimed at by the conspirators. It sounds high-flown and absurd, but
              consider the facts! Why should a thief try to break in at a
              bedroom window, where there could be no hope of any plunder, and
              why should he come with a long knife in his hand?”

              “Well, if Holmes takes the same view, that would account for his
              action, would it not? Presuming that your theory is correct, if he
              can lay his hands upon the man who threatened you last night he
              will have gone a long way towards finding who took the naval
              treaty. It is absurd to suppose that you have two enemies, one of
              whom robs you, while the other threatens your life.”

              “I have known him for some time,” said I, “but I never knew him do
              anything yet without a very good reason,” and with that our
              conversation drifted off on to other topics.

              But it was a weary day for me. Phelps was still weak after his
              long illness, and his misfortune made him querulous and nervous.
              In vain I endeavored to interest him in Afghanistan, in India, in
              social questions, in anything which might take his mind out of the
              groove. He would always come back to his lost treaty, wondering,
              guessing, speculating, as to what Holmes was doing, what steps
              Lord Holdhurst was taking, what news we should have in the
              morning. As the evening wore on his excitement became quite
              painful.

            <TextNode>“You have implicit faith in Holmes?” he asked.</TextNode>
            <TextNode>“I have seen him do some remarkable things.”</TextNode>
            <TextNode>

              “But you know him well, Watson. He is such an inscrutable fellow
              that I never quite know what to make of him. Do you think he is
              hopeful? Do you think he expects to make a success of it?”

              “On the contrary, I have noticed that when he is off the trail he
              generally says so. It is when he is on a scent and is not quite
              absolutely sure yet that it is the right one that he is most
              taciturn. Now, my dear fellow, we can't help matters by making
              ourselves nervous about them, so let me implore you to go to bed
              and so be fresh for whatever may await us to-morrow.”

              I was able at last to persuade my companion to take my advice,
              though I knew from his excited manner that there was not much hope
              of sleep for him. Indeed, his mood was infectious, for I lay
              tossing half the night myself, brooding over this strange problem,
              and inventing a hundred theories, each of which was more
              impossible than the last. Why had Holmes remained at Woking? Why
              had he asked Miss Harrison to remain in the sick-room all day? Why
              had he been so careful not to inform the people at Briarbrae that
              he intended to remain near them? I cudgelled my brains until I
              fell asleep in the endeavor to find some explanation which would
              cover all these facts.

              It was seven o'clock when I awoke, and I set off at once for
              Phelps's room, to find him haggard and spent after a sleepless
              night. His first question was whether Holmes had arrived yet.

              “He'll be here when he promised,” said I, “and not an instant

              And my words were true, for shortly after eight a hansom dashed up
              to the door and our friend got out of it. Standing in the window
              we saw that his left hand was swathed in a bandage and that his
              face was very grim and pale. He entered the house, but it was some
              little time before he came upstairs.
