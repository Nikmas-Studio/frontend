              Phelps raised the cover, and as he did so he uttered a scream, and
              sat there staring with a face as white as the plate upon which he
              looked. Across the centre of it was lying a little cylinder of
              blue-gray paper. He caught it up, devoured it with his eyes, and
              then danced madly about the room, passing it to his bosom and
              shrieking out in his delight. Then he fell back into an arm-chair
              so limp and exhausted with his own emotions that we had to pour
              brandy down his throat to keep him from fainting.

              Sherlock Holmes swallowed a cup of coffee, and turned his
              attention to the ham and eggs. Then he rose, lit his pipe, and
              settled himself down into his chair.

              “I'll tell you what I did first, and how I came to do it
              afterwards,” said he. “After leaving you at the station I went for
              a charming walk through some admirable Surrey scenery to a pretty
              little village called Ripley, where I had my tea at an inn, and
              took the precaution of filling my flask and of putting a paper of
              sandwiches in my pocket. There I remained until evening, when I
              set off for Woking again, and found myself in the high-road
              outside Briarbrae just after sunset.

              “Well, I waited until the road was clear—it is never a very

              fence into the grounds.”

              “Yes, but I have a peculiar taste in these matters. I chose the
              place where the three fir-trees stand, and behind their screen I
              got over without the least chance of any one in the house being
              able to see me. I crouched down among the bushes on the other
              side, and crawled from one to the other—witness the disreputable
              state of my trouser knees—until I had reached the clump of
              rhododendrons just opposite to your bedroom window. There I
              squatted down and awaited developments.

              “The blind was not down in your room, and I could see Miss
              Harrison sitting there reading by the table. It was quarter-past
              ten when she closed her book, fastened the shutters, and retired.

              “Yes, I had given Miss Harrison instructions to lock the door on
              the outside and take the key with her when she went to bed. She
              carried out every one of my injunctions to the letter, and
              certainly without her cooperation you would not have that paper in
              you coat-pocket. She departed then and the lights went out, and I
              was left squatting in the rhododendron-bush.

              “The night was fine, but still it was a very weary vigil. Of
              course it has the sort of excitement about it that the sportsman
              feels when he lies beside the water-course and waits for the big
              game. It was very long, though—almost as long, Watson, as when you
              and I waited in that deadly room when we looked into the little
              problem of the Speckled Band. There was a church-clock down at
              Woking which struck the quarters, and I thought more than once
              that it had stopped. At last however about two in the morning, I
              suddenly heard the gentle sound of a bolt being pushed back and
              the creaking of a key. A moment later the servant's door was
              opened, and Mr. Joseph Harrison stepped out into the moonlight.”

            <TextNode>“Joseph!” ejaculated Phelps.</TextNode>

            <TextNode>
              “He was bare-headed, but he had a black coat thrown over his
              shoulder so that he could conceal his face in an instant if there
              were any alarm. He walked on tiptoe under the shadow of the wall,
              and when he reached the window he worked a long-bladed knife
              through the sash and pushed back the catch. Then he flung open the
              window, and putting his knife through the crack in the shutters,
              he thrust the bar up and swung them open.

              “From where I lay I had a perfect view of the inside of the room
              and of every one of his movements. He lit the two candles which
              stood upon the mantelpiece, and then he proceeded to turn back the
              corner of the carpet in the neighborhood of the door. Presently he
              stopped and picked out a square piece of board, such as is usually
              left to enable plumbers to get at the joints of the gas-pipes.
              This one covered, as a matter of fact, the T joint which gives off
              the pipe which supplies the kitchen underneath. Out of this
              hiding-place he drew that little cylinder of paper, pushed down
              the board, rearranged the carpet, blew out the candles, and walked
              straight into my arms as I stood waiting for him outside the
              window.

              “Well, he has rather more viciousness than I gave him credit for,
              has Master Joseph. He flew at me with his knife, and I had to
              grasp him twice, and got a cut over the knuckles, before I had the
              upper hand of him. He looked murder out of the only eye he could
              see with when we had finished, but he listened to reason and gave
              up the papers. Having got them I let my man go, but I wired full
              particulars to Forbes this morning. If he is quick enough to catch
              his bird, well and good. But if, as I shrewdly suspect, he finds
              the nest empty before he gets there, why, all the better for the
              government. I fancy that Lord Holdhurst for one, and Mr. Percy
              Phelps for another, would very much rather that the affair never
              got as far as a police-court.

              I have heard from him this morning, I gather that he has lost
              heavily in dabbling with stocks, and that he is ready to do
              anything on earth to better his fortunes. Being an absolutely
              selfish man, when a chance presented itself he did not allow
              either his sister's happiness or your reputation to hold his
              hand.”

              “The principal difficulty in your case,” remarked Holmes, in his
              didactic fashion, “lay in the fact of there being too much
              evidence. What was vital was overlaid and hidden by what was
              irrelevant. Of all the facts which were presented to us we had to
              pick just those which we deemed to be essential, and then piece
              them together in their order, so as to reconstruct this very
              remarkable chain of events. I had already begun to suspect Joseph,
              from the fact that you had intended to travel home with him that
              night, and that therefore it was a likely enough thing that he
              should call for you, knowing the Foreign Office well, upon his
              way. When I heard that some one had been so anxious to get into
              the bedroom, in which no one but Joseph could have concealed
              anything—you told us in your narrative how you had turned Joseph
              out when you arrived with the doctor—my suspicions all changed to
              certainties, especially as the attempt was made on the first night
              upon which the nurse was absent, showing that the intruder was
              well acquainted with the ways of the house.”

            <TextNode>
              “The facts of the case, as far as I have worked them out, are
              these: this Joseph Harrison entered the office through the Charles
              Street door, and knowing his way he walked straight into your room
              the instant after you left it. Finding no one there he promptly
              rang the bell, and at the instant that he did so his eyes caught
              the paper upon the table. A glance showed him that chance had put
              in his way a State document of immense value, and in an instant he
              had thrust it into his pocket and was gone. A few minutes elapsed,
              as you remember, before the sleepy commissionaire drew your
              attention to the bell, and those were just enough to give the
              thief time to make his escape.

              “He made his way to Woking by the first train, and having examined
              his booty and assured himself that it really was of immense value,
              he had concealed it in what he thought was a very safe place, with
              the intention of taking it out again in a day or two, and carrying
              it to the French embassy, or wherever he thought that a long price
              was to be had. Then came your sudden return. He, without a
              moment's warning, was bundled out of his room, and from that time
              onward there were always at least two of you there to prevent him
              from regaining his treasure. The situation to him must have been a
              maddening one. But at last he thought he saw his chance. He tried
              to steal in, but was baffled by your wakefulness. You remember
              that you did not take your usual draught that night.”

              and that he quite relied upon your being unconscious. Of course, I
              understood that he would repeat the attempt whenever it could be
              done with safety. Your leaving the room gave him the chance he
              wanted. I kept Miss Harrison in it all day so that he might not
              anticipate us. Then, having given him the idea that the coast was
              clear, I kept guard as I have described. I already knew that the
              papers were probably in the room, but I had no desire to rip up
              all the planking and skirting in search of them. I let him take
              them, therefore, from the hiding-place, and so saved myself an
              infinity of trouble. Is there any other point which I can make
